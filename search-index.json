A disadvantage is that they rely on well-known user tracking tools that may be blocked by ad-blocking or other security software, so the usage statistics may not be completely accurate. To use this integration: Make sure each question in your interview has an id. The id specifier will be added automatically to interviews created with the Assembly Line Weaver. Example: id: this is the google or segment analytics idquestion: | What is your namefields: - Name: user_name Sign up for Google Analytics or Segment, and follow the Docassemble documentation to enable tracking with the system of your choice. This integration allows for very basic tracking. You can identify popular interviews, screens, and dropoff points. Perhaps the most important thing to track is to assign an id named download to your download screen. Then, inside Google Analytics, you can search for the keyword \"download\" under Behavior | Site Content | All pages. Note that the \"page url\" in Google Analytics will have the name of the package and YAML file inserted into the URL. This means you do not need to worry about prefixing the page IDs in order to uniquely track the usage of different interviews installed on your server.","s":"Collecting anonymous analytics with Google or Segment","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/analytics/tracking_usage","h":"#collecting-anonymous-analytics-with-google-or-segment","p":24},{"i":31,"t":"By default, every interview created by the Weaver includes this line in a mandatory code block: store_variables_snapshot({\"zip\": users[0].address.zip}) This code runs immediately before the download screen, providing a good proxy of completed interviews. It stores the user's zip code in the Docassemble datatabase, and can be used to run reports about anonymous usage. You can choose to narrow or expand the data that is captured with this tool. The default stores only the zip code, but if you remove all parameters, the user's full interview session will be captured in a simplified state. You can also manually add additional interview variables that you want to store. For example, if you wanted to store the user's city and the list of options they chose for a checkbox variable named user_preference: store_variables_snapshot({ \"zip\": users[0].address.zip, \"city\": users[0].address.city, \"user_preference\": user_preference.true_values() }) Docassemble interviews can store complex nested objects that don't fit neatly in a spreadsheet. If you want to manipulate the data later, you may want to \"flatten\" the data so that it is a neat linear list of fields. That will make later analysis easier. You may also want to adjust the time that the data is stored. If you add the parameter persistent=True, the data will persist even if the user's session is deleted, which may happen every 90 days in a default Docassemble server environment.

Subject matter experts, similarly, did not require a long-term commitment to the project, but did require some orientation to understand what an interactive legal application can and should do. Longer-term members of our team fit more naturally into other roles. People often changed roles and overlapped them over the time that they volunteered. For example: almost all of our members did some Docassemble development as they gained comfort and familiarity as the project went on. Project management is a learned skill that fit well with people who were outgoing and organized, and also did not demand extensive coding experience. We found it necessary to have a project manager role to make sure content actually got out the door. Otherwise, apps could spend too much time in the refining stage. The urgency of the pandemic helped us center delivering working apps as a goal.

Very basically, you tell the story table Step what question you want to get to and the variables and values it will need to get there. Whenever the test gets to a page, it checks your story table for any variables that match a variable on the page. When it finds a match, it sets the value of the field.

Comparing this to a story table, as described above, the first quotes contain the equivalent of the var column and the second quotes contain the value you want to set.

We recommend you just use 2 names - the first name and last name - but you can have all these formats: Firstname Lastname Firstname Middlename Lastname Firstname Middlename Lastname Suffix (where suffix is one of the dropdown suffix choices, like II) When I set the name of \"x[i]\" to \"Sam User\" The address Step is specifically for the Document Assembly Line 4-part address questions. It allows a US address format, but can otherwise be any address you want that matches the format of the example below. Remember the commas. When I set the address of \"users[0]\" to \"120 Tremont Street, Unit 1, Boston, MA 02108\" Use the story table Step to make sure the test reaches a particular screen given a set of fields with their values.

The situations that need this are pretty rare, but here's an example: You navigate to a new page and set a field. Sometimes the test passes, but sometimes the test says an element on this page does not exist. The problem is probably that the page sometimes needs an extra few seconds to load.

It also helps your code be more translatable in general. Add a unique id to each question block of your interview. This also helps your team communicate with each other more easily. Avoid noyes type fields. For one thing, the story table generator code will need less editing. For another, we've found that humans tend to find those confusing too. If your package is not importing specifically al_package.yml from the styled Assembly Line package, make sure to add the trigger variable code to your interview. You can write tests that just go part-way through an interview. That way, you can work on adding more content and yet also be sure that the work you've already done isn't affected by the new changes.

Making your guided interviews accessible is first and foremost about making them easy to understand and use. Following our advice about writing good questions can make your interview overall easier to understand and complete, which helps everyone! Other parts of web accessibility involve writing the interview in a way that the user's browser and other accessibility tools (like screen readers) can understand. Docassemble handles many of these things for you, but there are some parts that you'll have to address when writing your interview. To help you find accessibility problems in your interview you can use the WAVE browser extension, or if you want to check accessibility of your interview automatically, you can use the ALKiln testing framework.","s":"Making your interview accessible","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/coding_style_guide/accessibility","h":"","p":195},{"i":198,"t":"One thing that you have control over in your interviews is your interview \"branding\", including fonts, styles, and importantly, colors.

In docassemble, you should set the alt_text attribute of a DAFile, or use the set_alt_text() function. If you are writing HTML directly, you can add an alt property to any img tags you use (see below). <img src=\"my_image.png\" alt=\"A drawing of a flowchart: the question is 'do you have any children?', the option 'yes' leads to 'scenario 1', and the option 'no' leads to 'scenario 2'.\"/>","s":"Use alt-text with images","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/coding_style_guide/accessibility","h":"#use-alt-text-with-images","p":195},{"i":202,"t":"You should add alt-text to your organizations logo.

This is appropriate if the list of options represents the most common selections, and there is an obvious \"mode\" switch. For example, the checkbox might read \"My court is outside of Massachusetts\". fields: - What is your court name?: court_name required: False code: | list_of_courts - My court is outside of Massachusetts: outside_ma datatype: yesno - Enter your court's name: court_outside_ma_name show if: outside_ma if the combo box suggestions are validated by the interview, add some some of those suggestions into examples on the page (which makes them easier to discover for some users) and turn the field into a text input where the validation errors are descriptive.","s":"Avoid comboboxes","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/coding_style_guide/accessibility","h":"#avoid-comboboxes","p":195},{"i":214,"t":"Docassemble relies heavily on exceptions for its declarative logic system.

It works well when the number of items is not important to the user. For example, people usually know the number of children they have. They can count the number of bank accounts or income sources they have, but it's not a number they have in their mind already.

Our hope is to build a robust metric or set of metrics that can be used to highlight areas for improvement within a single form as well as to rank and compare forms across jurisdictions. As much as possible, this measure will be broadly applicable to both paper court forms and digital guided interviews, such as those built using the Assembly Line Framework. Tentatively, we are calling this metric the \"LitStyler\" score. Readability is just one small piece of what makes a form easy or hard for a litigant to complete. While readability scores focus on the content that appears on a page and the focus is often on words, sentences, and paragraphs, forms have very different features: Litigants answer questions on forms as well as reading words. Some questions require the litigant to lookup information from a third party or to remember dates or times, while others involve simple facts such as names and addresses. Instead of being organized in words, sentences, and paragraphs, forms typically involve short labels and fields (empty spaces where answers can be provided) and only occasionally incorporate longer narrative text. A label like \"Massachusetts Health ID number\" is short and therefore may score very high on readability metrics but be something the litigant needs to spend a lot of time locating. Fields can have various types, such as short answer, long answer, select one (radio buttons) or select many (checkboxes). Some types are easier to interact with than others. Forms can require litigants to disclose information that is very sensitive, such as bank account or Social Security numbers, or that triggers a strong emotional reaction, such as the details of an assault. An important feature of measuring and comparing forms is that sometimes information that imposes a high burden on the litigant is required to resolve the dispute. For example: a complaint asking for protection from abuse needs to disclose some information about the abuse. Our plan is to measure these features, but to score them separate from features that are most likely to be in the form author's control.","s":"The LitStyler Completion Ease Score","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/complexity/complexity","h":"","p":321},{"i":325,"t":"Our team started by gathering and analyzing the relevant literature, most of which focuses on the readability of longer narrative texts.

These label rules work like that too - you'll combine prefixes and suffixes to build your labels, so look out for that pattern: prefix_suffix Note: Every field label in a PDF has to be unique. They cannot be repeated. We'll talk more about that later, but it's good to remember.

In a form that creates a new case, the user of the form is always going to be the plaintiff or petitioner.","s":"Figure out who is using your form","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/document_variables","h":"#figure-out-who-is-using-your-form","p":380},{"i":391,"t":"Label parties to the case with party-specific labels​ The person who is using your form and the person who your form's user is opposing should always get one of the special labels below: Note: We made PDF labels singular because you can't work with lists in many PDF editors. DOCX variables representing people are all plural. Internally, all variables representing people are plural. PDF label DOCX label Use case user users, user[0], or user[n] (where n is any whole number; use sequentially Will display the full name of the person who is filling out the online form other_party other_parties, other_parties[0], or other_parties[n] The person suing or being sued by the person filling out the form; someone on the \"other side\" of the case. plaintiff plaintiffs, plaintiffs[0], plaintiffs[n] Plaintiff in the case if we don't know if the plaintiff is the user or other party. defendant defendants, defendants[0], defendants[n] Defendant in the case if we don't know if the defendant is the user or other party. petitioner petitioners, petitioners[0], petitioners[n] Petitioner in the case if we don't know if the petitioner is the user or other party. respondent respondents, respondents[0], respondents[n] Plaintiff in the case if we don't know if the plaintiff is the user or other party. If the form has room for two people on one side of the case, you can reference user1 and user2 (on a PDF) or users[0] and users[1] (in a DOCX). It's important to always use one of these 4 labels for people who are actually part of the case, since we use those internally in many many places in our standard questions and to communicate information to the court. Never use names like: Tenant Landlord Parent etc. that can be converted into party labels, like Plaintiff or Defendant, if the form is being used by the tenant or landlord or parent. Every form should have at least one of the 6 party labels above. It's best to use user/users and other_party/other_parties when you know that the form is always used by a plaintiff or defendant. For example, a form that is always used by a tenant in an eviction case will normally get labeled with user/users any place that the form mentions either tenant or defendant. In any form that starts a new case, we can always label the PDF with user where the plaintiff name goes. Use one of these exact prefixes for other \"people\" on the form when at all possible​ You may want to use other kinds of labels on the form for miscellaneous people who are associated with the form, but are not parties to the case. Using one of these labels below that we have pre-selected tells our tool that these are people, so we can handle things like addresses, birth dates, etc. correctly. We can freely add more labels to this list if you need them for your form. Ideally, talk to us about that before running your form through the weaver. Never use any of the labels below when the person identified by the label is a party to the case. For example, if they are the person using the form or the person who is on the opposing side of the case from the user of the form. PDF label DOCX label Use case spouse spouses, spouses[0], spouses[n] A spouse whose information goes on the form but is not a party to the case. child children, children[0], children[n] Any child whose information goes on the form. parent parents, parents[0], parents[n] A parent who is not a party to the case. guardian guardians, guardians[0], guardians[n] A guardian who is not a party to the case. caregiver caregivers guardian_ad_litem guardians_ad_litem attorney attorneys translator translators witness witnesses debt_collector debt_collectors creditor creditors These are are considered the prefixes we described before. unknown_role isn't something our program will account for, but it's a name you can use when you don't know what role name to use. It can remind you (or alert other folks) to get a consult from someone who would know more. People suffixes​ When these are people, they have similar things we want to record about them. For example, their first name (name_first). These will be our suffixes. When a field is for a plaintiff's first name, you will combine the two: plaintiff_name_first. These are pre-defined words you can use as field labels for a plaintiff: Label to use in the PDF When to use it plaintiff Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's full name plaintiff_name The same - label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's full name plaintiff_name_first Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's first name plaintiff_name_middle Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's middle name plaintiff_name_last Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's last name plaintiff_name_suffix Label for a field that asks for the suffix of the plaintiff's name plaintiff_gender Label for a text field asking for the plaintiff to write in their gender plaintiff_gender_female Label for a checkbox for a \"female\" gender choice plaintiff_gender_male Label for a checkbox for a \"male\" gender choice plaintiff_birthdate Label for a single field for the plaintiff's date of birth CONTACT INFORMATION plaintiff_address_address Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's house address plaintiff_address_unit Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's apartment number (deprecated) plaintiff_address_street Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's house address. Use plaintiff_address_address instead (deprecated) plaintiff_address_street2 Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's apartment number.

As we said, each field label in a PDF needs to be unique, but some forms ask for a field multiple times. For example, the plaintiff's name might come up more than once. In those cases, you add two underscores (__) and a number. This will go on the very end of the label, after all the suffixes. So, prefix_suffix__2, prefix_suffix__3, and so on: Label to use in the PDF When to use it plaintiff_name_first__2 Label for the second field that asks for that plaintiff's first name plaintiff_name_first__3 Label for the third field that asks for that plaintiff's first name plaintiff__2 Label for the second field that asks for that plaintiff's full name plaintiff__3 Label for the third field that asks for that plaintiff's full name And so on. How about the other person/organization types you told me about? All these pre-defined suffixes work the same for all of the person/organization types we listed. Label to use in the PDF When to use it defendant Label for a field that asks for the defendant's full name spouse_signature Label for a field that asks for the spouse's signature spouse_signature__2 Label for a field that asks for the spouse's signature a second time And so on.","s":"Information about people","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/document_variables","h":"#information-about-people","p":380},{"i":393,"t":"We have some pre-defined words for court information too.

Also, we can do some automation with custom labels too if they follow certain patterns. Important Rules​ Some things you really need to do or it will be very hard to write code for the labels: Field names must start with a letter or underscore (_) - not a number or anything else. Field names can only include letters, numbers, and underscores. No spaces or any other character. When you run across a large area that gives room for writing a paragraph, make sure it's one big field. Useful label conventions​ Code is also about communicating with each other. The label names you come up with now are ones people will need to work with in the future. You don't have to do too much, but try not to label things with Adobe's defaults or field1, field2, and so on. Here are some suggestions for making helpful labels: Please use all lowercase letters for all labels. The coders will really appreciate it. Separate multiple words in a label with an underscore: plaintiff_does_love_pie Make the labels descriptive. If they can be descriptive and short, that's even better. Avoid acronyms and abbreviations, other than very common ones such as id for identification. When you have several related fields in a row, it could help with automation if you make your own prefix and suffixes. Make a prefix out of the the feature that groups them together, e.g. asset_checking, asset_savings, etc. It makes alphabetical sorting easier. Additional suffixes to help with automation: Use verb/noun pairs for checkboxes. For example, plaintiff_is_parent, defendant_speaks_spanish, petitioner_has_assets, etc. For checkboxes with a yes/no pair, add _yes and _no to the end as an extra suffix.

To keep it simple, the interview will only file one type of case; this lets us hardcode a few pieces of information in our interview. We'll first need to find the right \"codes\" for our interview. Tyler's E-filing system defines specific codes for many different parts of the filing process, include the over-arching category of the case, the more specific case type, and even things like whether or not the filed document should be confidential or not. To find the right codes, navigate through the URLs provided by visiting https://efile.suffolklitlab.org:9000/jurisdictions/illinois/codes. Firefox will display clickable links that you can use to browse the different codes. For example, say we want to write an Adoption interview. The codes in Illinois are split by courts, so to see the case categories available to one particular court, say Adams, we can go to https://efile.suffolklitlab.org:9000/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/categories, and scroll through the responses until we find the \"Adoption\" entry, code 7306. We would then see the case types for Adoption cases in adams at https://efile.suffolklitlab.org:9000/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/case_types?category_id=7306&timing=Initial, which is 25361.

We are currently working on a better interface for finding and handling these codes at runtime based on our experiences in Illinois and Massachusetts. Stay tuned. For this guide, we'll stick with a single court, to make things simple to understand.

The metadata can include things like a case number, the names of parties, and codes that tell a clerk what kind of filing is being delivered. E-filing replaces delivering documents to the court by hand, mail, or courier. Traditionally, e-filing requires visiting a dedicated web page, creating an account, converting documents into PDF format, and then inputting a lot of confusing information, such as document type, filing codes, and court codes. The LIT Lab's primary tool is code that guided interview authors can incorporate to add a simple one-click e-file button into an existing guided interview. The interview author can pre-select or help the litigant select the proper codes. This removes the most challenging part of traditional e-filing. If the litigant qualifies for a fee waiver, they may not even be required to create an account. We have also created a very simple e-filing \"portal\" that works much like traditional e-filing websites. This is not a product we expect end-users to interact with just yet. There are many competing systems of e-filing, but often there is a monopoly vendor within a given jurisdiction. Often, the vendor may have a program that allows third-parties to deliver documents to the vendor. Then, the vendor takes care of delivering the document the rest of the way to the court's docket. If you think of the e-filing vendor as a corporate mail room, then third-party vendors like the Suffolk LIT Lab are the equivalent of UPS or FedEx. We just get the document to the building. The e-filing vendor handles getting it to the right desk.

ALDocumentBundle objects can be nested to allow you to group multiple individual template files into one document that the user can download. Both ALDocument and ALDocumentBundle objects can be either enabled or not. The Docassemble interview will seek logic that defines when the document should be included in the final output, letting you easily create interviews that have contingent documents.","s":"Overview","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/aldocument","h":"#overview","p":505},{"i":510,"t":"An ALDocument is a DADict that has top level attributes and points to one or more Docassemble attachment blocks. There are usually exactly two keys in the dictionary: preview and final, with the only difference being the presence or absence of a signature. Conditional logic inside the template or attachment block can be used to show or hide the signature depending on the value of the key so that the template does not need to be created twice. The signature_if_final method of an ALIndividual was created to simplify this common use case. Here's how to use an ALDocument: Create ALDocument objects in an objects block. Set any required attributes, like enabled, in the object block or in a separate code block. Define the key of the ALDocument in an attachment block using the variable name modifier. Usually, use one attachment block and define the variable name like this: variable name: some_al_document[i]. Optionally, reference the ALDocument inside an ALDocumentBundle. Example: ---objects: - letter: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"ssa_letter\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False)---attachment: - pdf template file: ssa_letter.pdf variable name: letter[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } Example: It's common in longer interviews to have the enabled attribute be defined in a code block, like this: ---objects: - main_document: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"main_document\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False) - insurance_rider: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"rider\", has_addendum=False)---attachments: - pdf template file: main_document.pdf variable name: main_document[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } - pdf template file: rider.pdf variable name: rider[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) }---code: | if total_cost > 1000: insurance_rider.enabled = True else: insurance_rider.enabled = False # or more concise but slightly harder to read: # insurance_rider.enabled = total_cost > 1000 In the example above, the insurance_rider document is only included in any bundles if the total cost of the project is over $1,000. Note that the enabled value is global for the interview session. If you want to use different logic in different bundles, you can easily create a separate ALDocument that references the same template file and attachment block. Attributes: filename: the display filename used for the document when it is downloaded title: the title shown on the download screen enabled: whether the document should be \"turned on\" when it is referenced in an ALDocumentBundle addendum: points to a variable representing an attachment block with a formatted addendum. The Assembly Line provides a good default addendum template that is flexible enough to work with many fields. overflow_fields: an ALAddendumFieldDict with each representing a field that has potential to be sent to the addendum if exceeds a pre-set length. has_addendum : set this to True or False to control whether the overflow_fields dictionary will be checked to decide whether or not to generate an addendum file. Optional; defaults to False. Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a PDF version of the completed template and any addendum. key is normally preview or final as_docx(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a DOCX version of the completed template and any addendum if the original is a DOCX template. key is normally preview or final. as_list(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a 1 or 2 item list which contains the template and its addendum, if any. need_addendum(): returns True if the addendum exists and there are overflow fields. has_overflow(): returns True if there are fields that trigger the addendum. overflow(): returns a list of just the fields that triggered the addendum. safe_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"safe\" value of field_name (the amount that is less than overflow_trigger) plus an overflow message. Used in an attachment block. overflow_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"unsafe\" value of field_name--the amount that exceeds the overflow_trigger.

Here's how to use an ALDocumentBundle: Create the ALDocumentBundle in an objects block. Add each ALDocument or nested ALDocumentBundle that your interview will sometimes produce to the bundle. Because the list is usually known in advance, it's common to include this in the object definition. Use the as_pdf() method on your preview screen to display a preview of the output without any signature. Use the download_list_html() and send_button_html() methods on your download screen. You can have as many or as few bundles as you would like. The Assembly Line convention is to use the following two bundles: al_user_bundle which should include a next steps document with instructions for your user al_court_bundle which leaves out the instructions and should have every document that you want the clerk to receive Stick with this convention if you expect to integrate with E-filing. Example: ---objects: - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[ssa_next_steps, letter]) - al_court_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[letter]) note You can nest ALDocumentBundles! Just create your bundle in a separate objects block and add it directly into the list of elements. This lets you create a document from multiple templates that you want the user to be able to open and print as one file.

If an address is an ALAddress, it has an address_fields() method that can be used inside a fields: code: | statement to insert a consistently formatted series of address fields. address_fields() will include an autocomplete method and is internationalized. Assembly Line question library questions use ALAddress objects for both the address and mailing_address attributes of people. Example: ---objects: - the_address: ALAddress---id: address questionsets: - the_address.address - the_address.cityquestion: | What is the address?fields: - code: | the_address.address_fields() See Addresses for more information and examples. note You must use sets with the address_fields() method. Otherwise Docassemble will not be able to find the block to provide a definition of the address fields. The address_fields() method includes the following optional parameters: country_code: if provided, will be used to control the list of states that is displayed as well as the default country in the country drop down. In the Assembly Line question library, country_code typically defaults to the value of AL_DEFAULT_COUNTRY default_state: default state, province, or sub locality. In the Assembly Line question library, default_state typically defaults to the value of AL_DEFAULT_STATE show_country: defaults to False. If enabled, a country drop down menu will be displayed. ALAddressList​ The ALAddressList class is simply a collection of ALAddresses. It is used to allow you to collect multiple addresses in one go and otherwise works exactly like the built-in Docassemble DAList object. The __str__() method of an ALAddressList has been modified so that using it displays a series of addresses on one line, separated by ;. This is used any place that Docassemble treats the variable as text, such as in a template, attachment block, or in a question or subquestion field. Example: ${ person.previous_addresses } might display 123 Main St, Boston, MA; 456 Broadway, Cambridge, MA. The previous_addresses attribute of an ALIndividual is an ALAddressList.","s":"ALAddress and ALAddressList classes","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/algeneral","h":"#ALAddress","p":539},{"i":546,"t":"The ALIndividual is an extension of the Docassemble Individual class. It should be used to represent both natural people and businesses or other entities. ALIndividual objects include the following methods that are not in the stock Individual class: signature_if_final(i) is meant to be used inside a template or attachment block with the ALDocument class. It displays the signature if and only if i == 'final'. phone_numbers() displays either mobile_number, phone_number, or both if both are present for use in a PDF form with only one space to list phone numbers. contact_methods() displays a list of the contact methods the user provided in the default question library \"contact information\" screen as a formatted string. Specifically, it will display mobile_number, phone_number, email, and other_contact_method. This may be helpful in a formatted letter. age_in_years() returns the individual's age as an integer (whole number), calculated from the individual's birthdate attribute. formatted_age() is like age_in_years() but returns a formatted string with years, months, weeks, and days included when relevant. The cutoff is 2 weeks to display days, 2 years to display months, and anything over 2 years displays only years. name_fields(person_or_business:str = 'person', show_suffix=True) is like address_fields() and is used to display a list of either 3 or 4 fields for a person's name. See Names address_fields() is a wrapper around the address_fields() method of an ALAddress with the same parameters. gender_fields(show_help=False) is like the address_fields() method but displays a list of vetted gender options. Read more about gender questions. initials() is used to return a string with the 1, 2, or 3 initial letters of a person's name. E.g., QKS for Quinten K Steenhuis. language_fields(choices=List[Dict[str, str]]) provides a language selector that sets the .language attribute of the user, together with an other fill-in. This should be the two-letter ISO language code. We recommend defining and passing a dictionary named al_language_user_choices which will also be used by built-in questions triggered from ql_baseline.yml. language_name() will return the language name in English. If there is a system-wide translation words.yml translation file and the user's interface is in that language, the language name will be translated. If the user selected an other option, the other option will be returned. Read-only attributes: The following are all read-only attributes you can use with PDF checkbox fields. They return True or False depending on the value of the gender attribute. gender_male gender_female gender_nonbinary gender_other (True if and only if the gender attribute is not \"female\" or \"male\") gender_unknown gender_self_described Relation to the Individual class​ The ALIndividual class inherits from Docassemble's Individual class, and all other methods of Individual work the same way as they do in the Individual class. ALPeopleList​ The ALPeopleList class is used to represent a group of people. Otherwise it works exactly like the built-in Docassemble DAList object. It also has the following additional methods: familiar() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with and joining the last two items familiar_or() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with or joining the last two items short_list(limit:int, truncate_string:str=', et. al.') returns a list that will be cut off at the limit provided. By default, , et. al. is appended. The text can be customized. note In the lists above, and and or can be translated using words.yml) Example: users.short_list(2) will display John Smith and Jane Smith, et. al. if the list contains John Smith, Jane Smith, and Jane Doe. et al is not used if the list is at or below the limit provided. Relation to the DAList class​ ALPeopleList inherits from Docassemble's DAList class, and retains all methods and attributes of a DAList. Specifically, the language methods, including the pronoun() and related methods, can be used to display the correct pronoun depending on the number and gender of the members of an ALPeopleList. E.g., users.pronoun_possessive() will return her if there is a single user with the gender attribute value \"female\", and their if there are multiple members of the list. These methods can be helpful inside single-language pleading templates but usually should not be used inside the interview itself, as they can make translation challenging. While there are language-specific versions of these methods, they can lead to odd ungrammatical \"fragments\". As tedious as it may be, the best practice for translation inside the interview is to use conditional logic for full sentences matching each gender and number.","s":"ALIndividual and ALPeopleList classes","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/algeneral","h":"#ALIndividual","p":539},{"i":548,"t":"Currently, the Assembly Line interviews provide these classes that you can use to target questions to a specific type of person: Tenant HousingAuthority Applicant Abuser Survivor Each class subclasses ALIndividual and shares its methods and attributes.

Because the \"umbrella\" pattern is not widely used on CourtFormsOnline, this block is not widely used at runtime. It is essentially optional although it is produced in all interviews that are run through the Weaver. It is most useful as a record of what the author intended when the form was run through the Weaver, and is also available for you to make use of in more complex \"umbrella\" interviews of your own.

This means that while you were making changes to your branch, changes were also made to the branch you are trying to merge with and they changed the same lines of code. Git will not decide which bits of code to keep where - you have to decide that. These are unavoidable and a pain to deal with. Everyone runs into them now and again and they are tricky to resolve without introducing bugs. tip Ways to reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts: If possible, make the goals of your branches small so that you only make a few changes on a branch before making a pull request with it. Merge pull requests in the order they were made. Avoid editing the same sections of code at the same time. If you are working with collaborators, try to make sure you are working on tasks that do not edit the same lines. You can still make your pull request, but GitHub will prohibit merging. There are two ways GitHub might handle merge conflicts: GitHub allows you to 'resolve' the conflict in GitHub itself by editing the files in GitHub. GitHub is unable to help you resolve the issue (it doesn't offer the option). Either way, the most reliable way to deal with this situation is, unfortunately, to redo your changes on top of the new code: Make the pull request as usual, but simply use it as a tool. The changes you made will be highlighted in the file comparison tab. In docassemble create a new Project and pull in the other branch (the one you want to merge with). Using the file comparison as a guide, manually add your changes back. Make sure functionality affected by your code changes still works the way it should.","s":"Merge conflicts","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/github","h":"#merge-conflicts","p":749},{"i":796,"t":"aka.

In GitHub, navigate to the file you think you changed. Copy the text in it. Put it in the left side of the diff checker. Press the button to compare the text.

But if you cannot find a matching label, use the general rules below to add as many custom labels as you need. Labels should be valid Python variable names that start with a letter​ PDF and DOCX labels should also work as valid Python variable names. The basic rule is that Python variable names need to start with a letter and can only contain letters, digits, and the _ underscore character. Some variable names are reserved and have a special meaning inside AssemblyLine interviews. You should not use a variable name on the reserved list. Doing so can lead to hard to track bugs. Variable names are case sensitive - make them all lowercase​ Field names are case sensitive. The convention is to never re-use variable names with different capitalizations to store different things. Stick with all lower case names for fields when possible. Use the Python snake_case format for field labels​ In PDFs, labels should be all one word, lowercase, with multiple words separated by an underscore, the _ character. This convention is called snake_case. Do not use a . symbol or [] inside a PDF field's label. In a DOCX file, you can use the . symbol as well as brackets [] but they have a special meaning. The . separates an object from its attribute, and the [] indicates that you are referencing a list of items. Beginners should avoid these symbols except when instructed to do so for one of the variable names below. Use short but descriptive labels​ Use variable names that are descriptive but also short. Avoid using abbreviations. A good rule of thumb is to spell out acronyms and initialisms for clarity, but to freely remove words other than nouns and verbs to keep the names short. Use a name you would still understand if you read it in a year. About 30 characters is a good limit to the length of a variable name. It's unusual to need more than that. If your variable name is shorter than 5 characters, it might not be descriptive enough. Some suggestions for coming up with custom labels​ There are no hard and fast rules other than the ones listed above, but here are some conventions that may help you: Drop words from the variable name that don't add specific meaning. Filler words like \"a\", \"the\", etc. are almost never needed. Stick with nouns and verbs. Yes/no variables (also called boolean) commonly start with a form of the verb \"to be\" or \"to have\", paired with a noun. E.g., is_attorney or has_notice_to_quit. You can also use other verbs--writes_docassemble or saved_status or wants_copies_returned. Do not include the type of variable in the variable name itself. It is usually redundant and is not a common Python style. Exception: you might add something like _list or _date that is both a type and is descriptive of the variable's real world contents. There are now a number of samples of interviews built with the Assembly Line framework that you can find online. You can get ideas for variable names to use in your interview that match if they apply to the same concepts. When you're stuck, feel free to ask for help! It's a good idea to get a second opinion the first few times you label a document. A fellow programmer may have some good ideas to make your variable names shorter, clearer, or more closely follow programming conventions.","s":"General rules for labels","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables","h":"#general-rules-for-labels","p":830},{"i":840,"t":"We have identified common fields that exist in most paper court forms: names of people addresses information that identifies the court signatures dates currency figures a pair of yes/no checkboxes docket numbers or court filing numbers We came up with a convention to identify the roles that people may play in relation to your form: The \"user\" of the form: the person who the form is being filed for, making a request or response to the court The \"other_party\" of the form: the person who the user is responding to or suing We have also identified some common names for people that appear across many forms.

Otherwise, return empty string. Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box. Defaults to 80. preserve_newlines bool - Determines whether newlines are preserved in the \"safe\" text. Defaults to False, which means all newlines are removed.

Typically there are three: The final version of a document with a signature. E.g., my_doc['final']. The preview version of a document with no signature. E.g., my_doc['preview']. An addendum of a document contained in the attribute addendum. E.g. my_doc.addendum. There is no limit to the number of keys, but the ALDocumentBundle class expects at least a \"final\" key to exist, and the addendum attribute is required if you desire to use PDF documents with text overflow. It is best practice to use exactly the two keys \"final\" and \"preview\" and the attribute \"addendum\". The \"final\" and \"preview\" documents will normally be the same template, but with logic controlling the display of a particular section, such as the signature. Each form that an interview generates should get its own ALDocument object. The \"addendum\" attribute can be handled in a generic object block. Multiple documents can use the same addendum template, with just the case caption varying. ALDocuments are designed to be used contingently as part of ALDocumentBundle objects. Each ALDocument is considered to be \"enabled\" or \"disabled\" for a particular interview user's session. This allows you to always work with a single object representing all of the possible documents an interview can generate, and use encapsulated logic to trigger individual documents inclusion on the final download screen. Attributes: filename str - name used for output PDF title str - display name for the output PDF enabled bool - if this document should be created. See examples. addendum DAFile | DAFileCollection - (optional) an attachment block overflow_fields ALAddendumField - (optional) ALAddendumFieldDict instance. These values will be used to detect and handle overflow. has_addendum bool - (optional) Defaults to False. Set to True if the document could have overflow, like for a PDF template. Notes: The enabled attribute should always be defined by a code block or the objects block, because by default it is considered fresh on each page load. If your interview logic requires that you directly ask the user whether or not to include a document, you can use a single intermediate variable that is posed to the interview user to work around this limitation.

Unfortunately, we still don’t have a good model for this and are looking for evidence-based research on it. Here are some unverified possibilities. For important choices, you can use a follow up screen to warn someone about their choice. If it’s not that important, you might consider skipping the validation completely. For radio buttons, you might only show the warning if they choose something you want to draw their attention to. A modal pop-up is one way to tell the user something might be wrong. Some people find those confusing and annoying. Another option is to show warning text under the field as soon as the user starts answering. You would hide it as soon as the answer looked good. You would allow the user to continue either way. With this method, some people may feel they’re being scolded before they’ve been given a chance to put in their answer. A possible way around the issue is to offer an “I know what I’m doing” checkbox that reveals a different field - one that won’t stop the user. Alternatively, you could have a review screen for the user before they submit their final answer and show the warning there.
