In designing this feature, we tried to reduce the number of questions a user needs to answer while still asking for specific enough expenses. We don't want to burden the user, but also don't want the user forget to list any significant expenses they would have that could prove financial burden. What expenses you want to initially ask about will depend on your community's needs. For example, if your community lives in northern rural areas, they might have alternative heating needs, like wood or oil, and might not immediately associate those costs with standard \"utilities\". If your community is in a flood plain, you might want to include flood insurance as an option.","s":"Guiding Philosophy","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alincome/expenses","h":"#guiding-philosophy","p":22},{"i":28,"t":"If you want to jump right in, check out a live demo of the ALExpense feature. ALExpense is a class that represents an amount that re-occurs periodically, like a monthly utility bill, or weekly grocery expenses. It has a few attributes: expense.value is the actual amount that is reoccurring. For example, someone's rental insurance might always be $50 each month. expense.times_per_year is the number of times each year that this amount occurs. If someone has to pay their landlord twice a month, times_per_year would be 24. This value can also be fractional if need be; an expense that only needs to be paid once every two years would have a times_per_year of 0.5. expense.source is the source, or name, of the expense. Food expenses could have a source of \"food\". expense.display_name is the name of the source that you want to display to the user. This helps with multi-lingual interviews, where you can show the user the name of the expense, but your interview logic can still refer to a single canonical language name. It also helps add or change additional context to the name that you don't want to write out in your interview logic. For example, expense.source could be \"medical insurance\", but expense.display_name could be \"Medical Insurance (including health, dental, and vision)\". You won't be using ALExpense by itself often though; you'll need a list of expenses from the user, which we'll discuss next.","s":"ALExpense","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alincome/expenses","h":"#alexpense","p":22},{"i":30,"t":"Let's make a short interview that just asks for someone's expenses.

You can customize the options shown to the user by including a definition of an expense_terms variable in your interview. Since the default list is pretty long, we'll make it shorter in this tutorial by copying the below variable definition block: # \"!!omap\" makes these terms ordered: # their order here will be their same order when shown to users.variable name: expense_termsdata: !!omap - rent: \"Rent\" - mortgage: \"Mortgage\" - food: \"Food\" - utilities: \"Utilities\" - clothing: \"Clothing\" - credit cards: \"Credit Card Payments\" - property tax: \"Property Tax (State and Local)\" - other taxes: \"Other taxes and fees related to your home\" - medical: \"Medical costs (including insurance)\" - transportation: \"Transportation costs\" - other: \"Other\" Here is what this question screen will look like: display_name As mentioned in the previous section, expense_terms provides the ALExpense objects in your ALExpenseList with the values for source and for display_name; everything to the left of the colon on each line is source and everything to the right is the longer display_name. For each expense that the user said they have, there will be one question screen, asking for how often they pay for that expense, and how much they pay. If they selected \"other\", they will also be prompted to enter the name of that expense. If you want to change the options for how often they pay the amount, you can define a times_per_year_list, similarly to the expense_terms above. By default, the list contains \"weekly\", \"once every two weeks\", \"twice per month\", \"monthly\", \"once every 3 months\", \"once every 6 months\", and \"yearly\". For this tutorial, let's make that list a little shorter. Add the below block to your code: variable name: times_per_year_listdata: - [52, \"Weekly\"] - [26, \"Once every two weeks\"] - [24, \"Twice per month\"] - [12, \"Monthly\"] - [1, \"Yearly\"] You can show let the user review the expenses they've entered with the following question block: id: expenses reviewquestion: | Review your expensessubquestion: | Here is what you've told us about your monthly expenses.

When you run its interview, you will be able to pick a Project from your Playground and run the tests in that Project. Pros You don't need to put your package on GitHub to run the tests. Running ALKiln on your server lets you loop through your development cycle faster - edit, test, edit, test. You don't have to go through committing your code to GitHub every time. You can see the output online right away, including images and documents. In GitHub, to see all of the output files, you have to download a zip file. The only thing you can see online in GitHub is the summary report. You can more easily limit your tests to a specific set of tests using tag expressions. You can use tags on GitHub too, it just takes more steps. You can more often avoid the red \"x\" that appears next to failing tests on GitHub. The red \"x\" is a useful piece of information, but it can be uncomfortable. Cons You'll miss catching some kinds of mistakes. Specifically, you may add a file to your Playground and forget to commit it to GitHub. Your tests will pass in your Playground, but your interview will break when you or others install it from GitHub. If your server reloads while the tests are running, ALKiln may come to a complete stop and you'll have to start the tests all over again. What ALKiln is doing When you run Playground tests, they do the following: ALKiln navigates to the file your tests specifies in the Project you picked. For each test (or Scenario), ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to whatever interview you named in the test in the Project you chose. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test. If one of the Steps fails, ALKiln adds that to the test report and tries to take a picture of the page with the problem. It tries to avoid taking pictures of sensitive information. When the tests are done, the output page will show you all the generated reports, images, and files if it can. It will also give you a link to download some of that in a .zip file.","s":"Testing your Playground Projects","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/advanced","h":"#testing-your-playground-projects","p":58},{"i":65,"t":"These tests run on GitHub, but they still interact with your server and basically do the same things the Playground tests do, you're just not there to see. Pros ALKiln on GitHub will test any changes any team member commits. On your server, you only tests your changes. On GitHub, there are ways to schedule tests to run regularly - every week, every day, or whatever schedule you prefer. If packages you depend on change and break your code, those tests will let you know. If you've forgotten to add a file to the package that an interview depends on (like a missing template file), GitHub will catch that. It installs the file fresh in a new Project, so it only has the files that have been committed properly. You can continue editing any files in your Playground while the GitHub tests run because GitHub creates a whole new Project of its own. When running tests on your server, you must avoid editing the Project that ALKiln is testing. You can configure your GitHub \"action\" to do other things, like create GitHub issues whenever tests fail. If your server reloads during the test run, a few individual tests may fail, but ALKiln will still be able to continue and keep trying to run the rest of the tests. That is because the test code is in running from GitHub, so your reload doesn't stop that process. Cons To get these set up, you need to create a docassemble API key, a GitHub token, and make GitHub secrets and you may have to update these in the future. The ALKiln test setup interview helps you do these things, but they can still be confusing. Your tests might be more flaky. That means they may fail for reasons that don't have to do with the interviews. For example, if your tests are running while your server is reloading, ALKiln will keep running, so other tests will still have an opportunity to continue, but individual tests may fail even if your code is correct. Your server can reload for many reasons - updating your config, installing a new package, etc. When tests fail meaninglessly, it slows down your development cycle and sometimes people end up turning off the tests instead of dealing with the complexity. What ALKiln is doing Whenever you push (or commit) to GitHub, GitHub will run the tests automatically. You can also trigger them manually. ALKiln goes to the testing account you set up on your server and creates a new Project. If you log into that account, you'll be able to see the new Project in the list of projects. It pulls the relevant branch of your package into the Project. For each test (or Scenario), ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to whatever interview you named in the test. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test. If one of the Steps fails, ALKiln adds that to the test report and tries to take a picture of the page with the problem. It tries to avoid taking pictures of sensitive information. When all the tests are done, ALKiln deletes the Project it created. You can see the tests running on your repository's GitHub Actions page. At the end, you can see a report and logs right in the workflow's \"job\" page or download a .zip file containing the results of the tests to your computer. That .zip file is what GitHub calls an \"artifact\".","s":"Triggering tests on your server from GitHub","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/advanced","h":"#triggering-tests-on-your-server-from-github","p":58},{"i":67,"t":"These tests also run on GitHub, but they create a new docassemble server on GitHub itself and interact with that. They never touch your server. Pros This is the most secure of all the methods. The tests don't interact with your server at all. Since the other tests should be running on a test server, not a production server, this shouldn't be a big advantage, but still - the tests have less chance of accidentally exposing the information of other users on that server. All the advantages listed above for the other type of GitHub tests except this improvement: Your tests will generally be less flaky. When a test fails it's more likely to be a problem with your code instead of a problem with the server. That's because the server is isolated on GitHub and no one is going to make that isolated server reload in the middle of the tests. You don't have to set up or update any docassemble API keys or GitHub tokens. Cons Tests take about 5 minutes longer since they have to do things like create a docker container and start a server. The GitHub server installs the latest version of docassemble, which might be a different version than the one you use on your server. Allowing authors to install specific versions would take longer to run. We're still considering if this is a feature we should create. We would appreciate feedback. Regardless of that, whatever server GitHub generates probably won't have the exact same setup as your server, so some interviews may not have the same behavior. You have to be more diligent about including all the \"Dependencies\" that your package needs on your interview's \"Packages\" page. If you don't, they won't be installed with your package on this fresh server. What ALKiln is doing Like the other GitHub test method, whenever you push (or commit) to GitHub, GitHub will run the tests automatically. You can run these manually as well. ALKiln creates a fresh docker container and docassemble server in GitHub itself. If you have given ALKiln a docassemble config, it uses that config. It tries to get the log for that process and saves it as an artifact on your GitHub action's summary page. It installs the interview as a package directly on the server. ALKiln does the same things we described above, creating the same GitHub artifacts. When all the tests are done, GitHub destroys the server that ALKiln created. tip If you do run both the GitHub-triggered tests and the GitHub isolated server tests, you'll get the fastest results possible. That is, if all goes well, the GitHub-triggered tests might end first and pass. If they don't and the problem is just with your server, the GitHub isolated server tests might complete sooner.

Google is widely used and free, but usage is reported to Google and used for purposes of selling advertisements. Segment is a commercial analytics tool with a paid tier. An advantage of Google Analytics and Segment is that the data will be stored for the long term and you do not need to worry about persisting it between server outages or upgrades, nor about retaining information long term on your server. A disadvantage is that they rely on well-known user tracking tools that may be blocked by ad-blocking or other security software, so the usage statistics may not be completely accurate. To use this integration: Make sure each question in your interview has an id. The id specifier will be added automatically to interviews created with the Assembly Line Weaver. Example: id: this is the google or segment analytics idquestion: | What is your namefields: - Name: user_name Sign up for Google Analytics or Segment, and follow the Docassemble documentation to enable tracking with the system of your choice. This integration allows for very basic tracking. You can identify popular interviews, screens, and dropoff points. Perhaps the most important thing to track is to assign an id named download to your download screen. Then, inside Google Analytics, you can search for the keyword \"download\" under Behavior | Site Content | All pages. Note that the \"page url\" in Google Analytics will have the name of the package and YAML file inserted into the URL. This means you do not need to worry about prefixing the page IDs in order to uniquely track the usage of different interviews installed on your server.","s":"Collecting anonymous analytics with Google or Segment","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/analytics/tracking_usage","h":"#collecting-anonymous-analytics-with-google-or-segment","p":68},{"i":75,"t":"By default, every interview created by the Weaver includes this line in a mandatory code block: store_variables_snapshot({\"zip\": users[0].address.zip}) This code runs immediately before the download screen, providing a good proxy of completed interviews. It stores the user's zip code in the Docassemble datatabase, and can be used to run reports about anonymous usage. You can choose to narrow or expand the data that is captured with this tool. The default stores only the zip code, but if you remove all parameters, the user's full interview session will be captured in a simplified state. You can also manually add additional interview variables that you want to store. For example, if you wanted to store the user's city and the list of options they chose for a checkbox variable named user_preference: store_variables_snapshot({ \"zip\": users[0].address.zip, \"city\": users[0].address.city, \"user_preference\": user_preference.true_values() }) Docassemble interviews can store complex nested objects that don't fit neatly in a spreadsheet. If you want to manipulate the data later, you may want to \"flatten\" the data so that it is a neat linear list of fields. That will make later analysis easier. You may also want to adjust the time that the data is stored.

Subject matter experts, similarly, did not require a long-term commitment to the project, but did require some orientation to understand what an interactive legal application can and should do. Longer-term members of our team fit more naturally into other roles. People often changed roles and overlapped them over the time that they volunteered. For example: almost all of our members did some Docassemble development as they gained comfort and familiarity as the project went on. Project management is a learned skill that fit well with people who were outgoing and organized, and also did not demand extensive coding experience. We found it necessary to have a project manager role to make sure content actually got out the door. Otherwise, apps could spend too much time in the refining stage. The urgency of the pandemic helped us center delivering working apps as a goal.

The items in the table are a snapshot of the user who is filling out the form for that test. Example: And I get to the question id \"has sink\" with this data: | var | value | trigger | | last_haircut_date | today - 730 | last_haircut_date | | wants_virtual_haircut | True | last_haircut_date | | user_name | Beth | user_name | | intro_screen_accepts_terms | True | intro_screen_accepts_terms | The row with | var | value | trigger | is required. How it works: You tell the Story Table Step what question you want to get to. You also make a table of the variables and values the test will need to fill in on its way to that page. Whenever the test gets to a page, it checks your Story Table for any variable names in the table that match a variable name on the page. When the test finds a match, it sets the field to the corresponding value. When the test is done filling in fields on a page, it continues to the next page and repeats until it reaches that question id you gave. As you can see in the example, the order of the items doesn't matter. The test will fill in the fields no matter what order they come in. You will be able to make simple edits to the interview without needing to update your tests. For example, you can move pages around or even move fields to different pages. It also doesn't matter if you include extra items accidentally, though you might want to check the test reports to make sure no necessary fields went unused. You can write a Story Table that goes all the way through your interview, or a Story Table that only goes part way.

For example, for this YAML code the value would be \"cuddly_bear\", not \"Teddy bear\". \"Teddy bear\" is just the label. question: Fav bearfield: - Pick one: users[i].favorite_bear data type: radio choices: - Black bear: wild_bear - Brown bear: also_wild_bear - Teddy bear: cuddly_bear - Jaime: maybe_not_a_bear One special value you can use is today. That will insert the date on which the test is being run. You can subtract or add days using today. Examples: When I set the variable \"signature_date\" to \"today\" When I set the variable \"birthdate\" to \"today - 500\" When I set the variable \"court_date\" to \"today + 12\" Be careful with today math. If you're testing a \"boundary\" date, you want to pick a date that is well within a boundary to make the test more robust. For example, if you want to test a date that was 10 or fewer days ago, use today - 9 instead of today - 10. At some point your tests might run over midnight. In that situation, if you used 10 the clock would tip into the next day - 11 days from the filled-in date. Your test would fail incorrectly. In fact, your users might have that experience, so design your interview with that in mind. For example, you can tell them the date of the deadline so they too will know about the boundary. You can also use environment variables to set values with the secret variables Step, even if the value doesn't need to be secret. The secret variables Step can set variables that have sensitive information. For example, a password. The value of this variable will not appear anywhere in the report or in the console. If there is an error on this page, ALKiln will still avoid taking a picture of the screen. This is a complex Step to use and currently only works with tests running in GitHub (though it's in development for the Playground version). You can use a GitHub \"secret\" to store the value. To learn how to create and add a secret for the test, see the GitHub secrets section. I set the variable \"user_account_password\" to the GitHub secret \"USER1_PASSWORD\" caution You MUST use the log in Step if you want to sign into your docassemble server. The secret variables Step shown here is unable to do that. Sign on a signature page. All signatures are the same - one dot. danger AVOID taking screenshots of signature pages. There's a bug that will erase the signature if you do that. When I sign You can also tap or click on specific elements, like buttons on a page. You can use any valid CSS Selector to get an element on the page, and can add any additional wait time after tapping the element. When I tap the \"#element-id\" element And I tap the \"#other-element\" element and wait for 5 seconds If you are using the ALToolbox tabs, you can say that you're tapping the tab, and ALKiln will tap and wait until the tab is fully visible. When I tap the \"TabGroup-specific_tab_name-tab\" tab Use the story table Step to make sure the test reaches a particular screen given a set of fields with their values. See a better description in sections above. I get to the question id \"some question block id\" with this data: The name Step is specifically for the Document Assembly Line 4-part name questions. Avoid punctuation. We recommend you just use 2 names - the first name and last name - but you can have all these formats: Firstname Lastname Firstname Middlename Lastname Firstname Middlename Lastname Suffix (where suffix is one of the dropdown suffix choices, like II) When I set the name of \"x[i]\" to \"Sam User\" The address Step is specifically for the Document Assembly Line 4-part address questions. It allows a US address format, but can otherwise be any address you want that matches the format of the example below. Remember the commas. When I set the address of \"users[0]\" to \"120 Tremont Street, Unit 1, Boston, MA 02108\"","s":"Set values","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln","h":"#set-values","p":80},{"i":129,"t":"Use the download Step to download files so that humans can check that they are correct. When the tests run in GitHub, the files will be in the GitHub action's artifacts. If you think this step could take more than 30 seconds, use the \"maximum seconds for each Step\" Step to give the file more time to download. Then I download \"file-name.pdf\" Leave out other parts of file's url. You can compare example PDFs (sometimes called a baseline) to downloaded PDFs to make sure they're the same. The baseline PDF must be stored in your \"Sources\" folder along with your tests, and the downloaded PDF should have been downloaded by the above step (Then I download \"download.pdf\") earlier in the same scenario. Then I expect the baseline PDF \"baseline.pdf\" and the new PDF \"download.pdf\" to be the same This will compare all of the text in the baseline PDF with all of the text in the newly downloaded PDF, and then it'll compare the fillable fields of each. If anything is different, it will print out what differed in the report. You can use that info and search for the differing text in the baseline PDF and in the download PDF in the artifacts to see how they differ. Use the upload step to upload one or more files. You must store files that you plan to upload in your \"Sources\" folder along with your tests. As you can see in the examples, if you want to upload more than one file you must separate their names with a comma. And I upload \"irrefutable_evidence.jpg, refutable_evidence.pdf\" to \"evidence_files\" In a story table, use the name of the variable as usual and use the name of the file or files in the value column. | evidence_files | irrefutable_evidence.jpg, refutable_evidence.pdf | | Use the custom timeout Step to give your pages or Steps more time to finish. The default maximum time is 30 seconds. This Step can be useful if you know that a page or an interaction with a field will take longer. You can also use it to shorten the time to let tests fail faster. If you need, you can use it in multiple places in each Scenario. Then the maximum seconds for each Step is 200 Use the wait Step to pause once a page has loaded. will let you wait for a number of seconds when you are on a page. The time must be shorter than the maximum amount of time for each Step. By default, that's 30 seconds, but you can increase that with the \"maximum seconds for each Step\" Step. When I wait 10 seconds This Step can be used multiple times. Waiting can help in some situations where you run into problems with timing. The situations that need this are pretty rare, but here's an example: You navigate to a new page and set a field. Sometimes the test passes, but sometimes the test says an element on this page does not exist. The problem is probably that the page sometimes needs an extra few seconds to load. Add this step in to give it that time.

It also helps your code be more translatable in general. Add a unique id to each question block of your interview. This also helps your team communicate with each other more easily. Avoid noyes type fields. For one thing, the story table generator code will need less editing. For another, we've found that humans tend to find those confusing too. If your package is not importing specifically al_package.yml from the styled Assembly Line package, make sure to add the trigger variable code to your interview.

It can look something like the below: env: MAX_SECONDS_FOR_SERVER_RELOAD: \"${{ secrets.MAX_SECONDS_FOR_SERVER_RELOAD }}\" You can also set its value without a secret as this value is probably not sensitive information. env: MAX_SECONDS_FOR_SERVER_RELOAD: \"300\" You can read the GitHub secrets section on setting arbitrary environment variables for more background information. info Your server can reload whenever someone saves a python file or whenever a developer or another test pulls a package that contains a python file into the Playground. If a test is running while that happens, the page the test is trying to open might take too long to load and the test will fail. This is unhelpful to you because the test stops part way and you cannot tell if it would have failed or passed on its own. The next test might then fail during the same reload. That becomes a problem when a chain of tests fail because of one reload. ALKiln cannot stop the first test from failing, but MAX_SECONDS_FOR_SERVER_RELOAD can help prevent the next tests from failing during the same reload.","s":"ALKiln environment variables","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln","h":"#alkiln-environment-variables","p":80},{"i":179,"t":"See the GitHub secrets section on setting arbitrary environment variables.

To see it: Go to your GitHub repository. Tap on the .github folder, then on workflows, then on the YAML file in there that runs the ALKiln tests. You can tap to edit the file if you want. The object in your workflow file that defines the triggers is named on. You can think of it in a sentence - \"on push, run this workflow\".

Use a \"tag expression\" specify which tagged tests to run (https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/#tag-expressions)' The keys that trigger the workflow (e.g. push and workflow_dispatch) can be in any order. Scheduled tests​ You can also run these tests on a schedule - daily, weekly, monthly, or on any other interval. To run the tests on a schedule, you must add schedule to the on object in your workflow file and give it an \"interval\" value. For example: on: push: schedule: - cron: '0 1 * * TUE' # other stuff The GitHub docs can tell you more about triggering workflows on a schedule.

Forward thinking courts have readability targets of 6th grade. But because people don't just read forms--they answer questions and follow instructions--readability isn't a very good measure of form complexity, at least not on its own: Forms use lots of short text (like: Address, Name, and so on), while readability scores are designed to evaluate long narratives. Litigants answer questions and follow instructions on forms as well as reading words. Answers can require getting information from a third party, finding a specific piece of paper (like an ID card), doing math, or making a decision. Answers can be very sensitive, either because they are about private information, like a Social Security Number, or because they evoke a traumatic response, like details of an assault. Answers come in different formats, too. The difference between checking a box and writing out a long answer is significant. Complexity and sensitivity can't always be avoided. For example: a complaint asking for protection from abuse needs to disclose some information about the abuse. But forms should never impose a burden on the litigant that doesn't have a matching benefit.","s":"Why readability scores aren't good enough","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/complexity/complexity","h":"#why-readability-scores-arent-good-enough","p":363},{"i":376,"t":"We built the RateMyPDF score by combining feedback from: Form automators Form authors Legal aid experts Court staff And our own in-house experience from building the Document Assembly Line.

The gold standard for improving forms is an individual usability test. You can run a usability test for as little as a few hundred dollars and half a dozen hours of time, and we think you should! We have written up a short guide to usability testing here. But usability testing: Can still be expensive or difficult to do at scale Requires applying judgment to disaggregate the causes of poorly performing forms. We think mechanical scores can be very helpful to sort and classify large numbers of forms at once and to provide a basic direction for improving even individual forms when not applied dogmatically.","s":"Inherent limitations in mechanical scores","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/complexity/complexity","h":"#inherent-limitations-in-mechanical-scores","p":363},{"i":383,"t":"Bryce Willey Quinten Steenhuis David Colarusso And we worked closely with: Caroline Robinson Lily Yang Michelle B. to identify and validate the features the RateMyPDF score measures.","s":"Who built this","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/complexity/complexity","h":"#who-built-this","p":363},{"i":385,"t":"Barbara Bezdek. 1991.

Using bootstrap.build is the simplest option for most authors. Visit the bootstrap.build website. Click the button to open the Builder Customize the options that you want to customize. Typically those will include: Under color system, the $gray/$blue/etc. colors, if you use a matching color in your theme Under color system, almost always the variables primary, secondary, success, info, warning, danger, light and dark Under Typography, customize any fonts that you wish to use Under forms, you may want to customize button size and rounded edges Click the \"export theme\" button (it may be hidden behind a banner at the top of the page) and choose the \"bootstrap.min.css\" option. Rename this theme to be more specific. Optionally, download the _variables.scss file so that you can easily load and adjust your settings in future. Next, you will need to make a small adjustment to the theme generated by bootstrap.build. Copy and paste the code below into the bootstrap.min.css file (or your new file name). .visually-hidden { clip: rect(0 0 0 0); clip-path: inset(50%); height: 1px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; white-space: nowrap; width: 1px;} .bg-dark { background-color: #1a73e8!important; /* replace with your desired nav bar color */} Add this theme to your Docassemble playground using the Folders | Static menu.

If you prefer more control over building the theme, you can create a custom theme from the bootstrap source code. The Bootstrap documentation covers the details of theming if you want to take this approach. Create a new custom.scss file anywhere on your computer to contain the SASS/CSS styles for your branding. Detailed instructions on what this file can contain are in the Bootstrap documentation. You can use a color theme generator like Huemint.com to make sure that you have a consistent set of all 9 Bootstrap variables. When you use the color theme generator, at the bottom of the page, you will see a small snippet of code that you can copy into the customs.scss file. For example, your new custom.scss might look like this: // Custom.scss// Option A: Include all of Bootstrap// Include any default variable overrides here (though functions won't be available)$white: #ffffff;$theme-colors: ( \"light\": #d8e2a5, \"dark\": #1b1b1b, \"primary\": #25dec6, \"secondary\": #375b5a, \"info\": #d74d72, \"success\": #0cb545, \"warning\": #f4ca0b, \"danger\": #fa043c,);// Note: we placed our custom.scss file in the bootstrap path for simplicity,// so we use a different path than in the bootstrap documentation// @import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";@import \"bootstrap\";// Then add additional custom code here Once you have written your custom.scss file, you can use the ALDashboard (which you can install on your docassemble server) to compile a custom Bootstrap theme. If you are associated with the Suffolk LIT Lab and have an account on the Suffolk Development server, you can visit a live version of the tool to try it out. At the end of the tool, you can view what all of the different bootstrap components will look like with your theme. If you want to change any of the colors, you can go back and edit your \"custom.scss\" file and regenerate the bootstrap theme. Once you like the colors you've chosen, download the compiled file, and then add it a docassemble project, in the static folder. You can then reference your new file by adding a bootstrap theme feature to your interview: features: bootstrap theme: my_bootstrap_theme.css Running node and npm to build a Bootstrap config (optional)​ If you don't have access to a docassemble server yourself, you can also compile a bootstrap theme from source using node and npm. Use a computer with a current version of Node. The instructions on this page assume you are using an Ubuntu Linux computer with Node installed, but they should be the same on any workstation. They were tested on a machine running Windows 11 with Ubuntu running under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It also assumes that you have VS Code installed, but you can use any text editor of your choice. First, download the Bootstrap source, and install its dependencies.

Handling court hierarchies is a complicated task, and something that the AssemblyLine can't do for you. You'll need to make your own way to let users select what court they want to file in depending on your jurisdiction. See our documentation for al_courts for some possible ideas. You should be able to run the interview now. If this is the first time you're running the interview on the server, you will be asked to log in to eFileIL. If you don't yet have an account, you should be able to make a new pro-se user account with eFileIL by following the links to make a new account on the page. Once you've logged in on the server, subsequent runs of the interview won't ask you to log in, until the eFileIL token expires and you have to log in again, in about 1-2 hours. The next page will ask if you want to search by party name or by case number. For now, let's search by case number. If you select \"case number\", and then enter the case number \"2022SC9\", you should find a case, John Smith vs. Bob Doe, a small claims case. info This case search worked at the time of writing (February 28th, 2023). However, courts have removed older cases from their staging servers before, and it is possible that this search won't work in the future. You can try searching common names like \"John Brown\" or \"John Smith\", or you could ask a court official if they are able to provide you with some testing case numbers from their staging server. We recommend that you build a working relationship with your local courts so they can help you with details like this. You can also go back and search by \"Party name\" instead. You can enter the name \"John Smith\", press continue, and wait. Searching by party name takes longer on eFileIL's server, especially on the staging server, you might have to wait around 30 seconds. Once the search completes, you will see that there are many cases involving John Smith. For speed purposes, the EFSP library only gets information about the first 8, and let's you click the next button to see the next 8. If you select the John Smith vs. Bob Doe case, you then see the last page in the interview YAML; show_all_info. This page shows all of the information that you, the interview author, can use from the case_search.found_case, the variable for the found case. The details and case_details attributes aren't stable APIs, but you might find the following attributes useful: court_id, the court that this case came from. Some courts have sub-courts that handle specific case types, so even though you searched for cases in the \"adams\" court, you should use this value for the rest of the interview. participants, an ALPeopleList object that has all of the participants in the case on both sides. each participant has a party_type and party_type_name, i.e. participants[0].party_type_name might be \"Plaintiff/Petitioner\". These values are Tyler e-filing codes that are set by the court. attorneys is a dictionary that contains any attorneys that are a part of the case. efile_case_type is the Tyler e-filing code for the type of case. This is useful if your interview is only relevant for certain case types. If users don't or can't fill out your form for their case, you can send users to a page that says they don't need this form and why. docket_number has the case number of the court. \"Docket number\" is the term that Massachusetts uses for a unique number assigned to each case by the court.

If you need to check the value of multiple variables in one if statement, you need to use the more complex js show if. When you use js show if, you need to use a JavaScript expression that uses the function val() at least once. val() is a JavaScript function that returns the value of a variable name that is visible on screen. It takes the name of the Docassemble variable in quotes as its only parameter. Here is a small example of a js show if expression: ---id: Tell me more about Respondentquestion: | Tell me more about the ${ other_parties[0] }.fields: - Is ${ other_parties[0] } employed?: other_parties[0].is_employed datatype: yesnoradio - Is ${ other_parties[0] } a parent of your child?: other_parties[0].joint_parent datatype: yesnoradio - ${ other_parties[0] }'s monthly income: other_parties[0].income datatype: currency js show if: | val(\"other_parties[0].is_employed\") && val(\"other_parties[0].joint_parent\") Check the js show if documentation to learn how to use different combinations of values in a js show if expression. The key is that you'll use ordinary JavaScript keywords to do any comparisons. JavaScript is its own language, and keywords such as \"or\", \"and\" and even \"==\" work slightly differently, as explained in the Docassemble documentation.

The question might be needed to ask another question, such as a name to personalize a question, or an address to locate a court. You may have made a typo or mistake with your variable names, and ended up asking something that is also defined by an Assembly Line question. This could lead to 2 or more very similar questions. You might not have defined something, like the party roles, that your interview now needs to know in order to make sense.","s":"Why is this question getting asked?!!!","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/customizing_interview","h":"#why-is-this-question-getting-asked","p":458},{"i":491,"t":"Assembly Line interviews almost always have some questions that come from the \"question library.\" The question library is just a YAML file named ql_baseline.yml. It contains questions about people's names, addresses, birthdates, gender and pronouns, and party roles. You can always write your own version of a question in the library. Docassemble reads your YAML file from top to bottom, so if you add your question that defines the same variables after the include block, Docassemble will always use your version. You maybe shouldn't write your own version. The question library questions are tested by real users. Some customization is to be expected, but be sure you have a clear reason for your choice. Question library questions don't appear in your own YAML file. But you can copy them when your interview is running. Here's how: In the top navigation bar, click the \"source\" button (it looks like </>). Scroll down until you see the question text. Copy it into your own YAML file. Near the other question blocks in your interview is the best place. Add the --- separator at the beginning of the block you copy. Make the changes that you want. About generic object The generic object modifier is a special way to make one question work for many different objects, like people or lists of people. When you customize a question from the question library, you may want to make it specific to one variable in your interview, rather than replace the generic version of the question for any person. To make it specific: Remove the generic object line. Replace x with your variable name. Customize the question and subquestion as needed. For example, suppose your interview asks for a list of guardians. There is no special question about guardians in the question library, so your interview will use the generic object version of the question, which looks like this: ---id: name of the first personsets: - x[0].name.first - x[0].name.last - x[0].name.middle - x[0].name.suffixgeneric object: ALPeopleListquestion: | % if hasattr(x, 'ask_number') and x.ask_number and x.target_number == 1: Name of ${ noun_plural(x.object_name(),1) } % else: Name of your first ${ noun_plural(x.object_name(),1) } % endiffields: - code: | x[0].name_fields() Here is a version made specific to guardians: ---id: name of the first personsets: - guardians[0].name.first - guardians[0].name.last - guardians[0].name.middle - guardians[0].name.suffixquestion: | What is the name of the first person you want to name as guardian?fields: - code: | guardians[0].name_fields() A specific version of a question is always used before the generic object version. About the variable i Just like generic object works for any object, the variable i (and other index variables) lets you write a question for any item in a list. Using a specific number (typically, just the first, or 0th item is treated specially) overrides the one that uses the letter i.","s":"Understanding the question library","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/customizing_interview","h":"#understanding-the-question-library","p":458},{"i":493,"t":"Every screen in Docassemble is asked for a reason, and you can always find out why.

This may look like the interview is asking the same question twice. But in fact, by using a unique way to ask for the user's name, you are asking for two pieces of information. Most likely, the best way for you to fix this is to remove the references to users1_first_name in your YAML file. You don't need to run the PDF through the Weaver again! You can just delete the incorrect references and update the attachment block to link the correct variable with the incorrect name in the PDF.

When you ran the Weaver, you were asked if the person was the plaintiff, defendant, or could be either. If you answered \"could be either\" your interview will ask for this information. Fix this by customizing the form type. Similarly, you were asked early in the Weaver if there could be one, any number, or at least one for every list of people in your interview.

To find the right codes, navigate through the URLs provided by visiting https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes. Firefox will display clickable links that you can use to browse the different codes. For example, say we want to write an Adoption interview. The codes in Illinois are split by courts, so to see the case categories available to one particular court, say Adams, we can go to https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/categories, and scroll through the responses until we find the \"Adoption\" entry, code 7306. We would then see the case types for Adoption cases in adams at https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/case_types?category_id=7306&timing=Initial, which is 25361.

We'll use the following codes: variable name purpose example value example meaning efile_case_category the over arching category of the case \"7306\" Adoption efile_case_type the specific type of case \"25361\" Adoption efile_case_subtype optional, if there needs to be more specific case types N/A N/A party_type what the role of an individual or party is in the case \"7067\" or \"20640\" Adoptive parent or child filing_type what the filing actually is, usually the name of the document \"29730\" Application document_type If the document is confidential or not \"5766\" Non-confidential filing_component If this is the lead document or if it's an attachment \"332\" Lead document","s":"Get the information needed to file","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/efiling/docassemble","h":"#get-the-information-needed-to-file","p":545},{"i":558,"t":"Now that we have all of the codes that we want, we need to define the right variables, setting their values to the codes we found above. Your interview must define the list of ALIndividual, users and other_parties. Each individual should have at least a first name. Note that if only a first name is provided, then the person is assumed to be a business. users[0] is almost always the person completing the interview, or at least who the form is being completed on behalf of. For each object in users and in other_parties, your interview needs to define the following attributes: party_type: this should be the Tyler party type code of that user is_new: if you are filing into an existing case and are adding additional participants to the case, this should be true. They aren't necessary since this interview is making an initial case (where all parties are implicitly new). users[0].email must be defined. Email is not required for any other parties. code: | trial_court = 'adams` efile_case_category = '7306' efile_case_type= '25361'---code: | users[i].name.first if i == 0: users[i].email users[i].party_type = '7067' # adoptive parent users[i].completed = True---code: | other_parties[i].name.first other_parties[i].party_type = '20640' # adoptive child other_parties[i].completed = True The following variables must also be defined: user_started_case: an Assembly Line variable determining if the users are plaintiffs/petitioners. lead_contact: this is the person who will be contacted about the status of this filing, and can just be set to users[0]. tyler_payment_id: This is the payment information that Tyler needs to collect payment for the filing. It is the string of the payment method ID. We'll deal more with this in the advanced guide (coming soon), but for now, we'll assume that the filer qualifies for a fee waiver, and can use the global waiver payment account, \"global\" meaning that any filer can use when filing. You can get this waiver payment account from the config: get_config('efile proxy', {}).get('global waiver', ''). al_court_bundle should be an ALDocumentBundle, containing all of the documents that you want to file. Each top level ALDocument or ALDocumentBundle in al_court_bundle will be treated as a separate filing, and each filing needs the following attributes: filing_component and filing_type filename: this will be defined by default when declaring the ALDocument filing_parties: these are the parties that are initiating the filing. When the party that's filing is also being added in that filing, the value is the instanceName of docassemble var representing that individual.

The metadata can include things like a case number, the names of parties, and codes that tell a clerk what kind of filing is being delivered. E-filing replaces delivering documents to the court by hand, mail, or courier. Traditionally, e-filing requires visiting a dedicated web page, creating an account, converting documents into PDF format, and then inputting a lot of confusing information, such as document type, filing codes, and court codes. The LIT Lab's primary tool is code that guided interview authors can incorporate to add a simple one-click e-file button into an existing guided interview. The interview author can pre-select or help the litigant select the proper codes. This removes the most challenging part of traditional e-filing. If the litigant qualifies for a fee waiver, they may not even be required to create an account. We have also created a very simple e-filing \"portal\" that works much like traditional e-filing websites. This is not a product we expect end-users to interact with just yet. There are many competing systems of e-filing, but often there is a monopoly vendor within a given jurisdiction. Often, the vendor may have a program that allows third-parties to deliver documents to the vendor. Then, the vendor takes care of delivering the document the rest of the way to the court's docket. If you think of the e-filing vendor as a corporate mail room, then third-party vendors like the Suffolk LIT Lab are the equivalent of UPS or FedEx. We just get the document to the building. The e-filing vendor handles getting it to the right desk. From a court clerk's point of view, the filing looks just like a filing uploaded through the vendor's first-party system.","s":"What is e-filing?","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/efiling/overview","h":"#what-is-e-filing","p":561},{"i":568,"t":"The LIT Lab is a certified EFSP, or Electronic Filing Service Provider, for the Tyler Technologies system.

Interviews request a fee calculation, pass off control to the Tyler Payment Gateway, and then once payment is completed control passes back to the interview. The Suffolk e-filing server also allows filing cases with a fee waiver. Some courts may require that the litigant provide payment information even if they have filed a fee waiver. That can be a court-by-court decision. Payment information is never stored on the Suffolk e-filing server, or inside the guided interview.

If anything is incorrect or doesn't work as expected, feel free to email us at massaccess@suffolk.edu. If you are expecting to file into different courts, a potential complication is that some courts have different codes for the same cases. For example, Peoria county's Adoption code is 7405, and the Adoption case type is 5892. The good news is that most case categories and case types have the same name. You can hardcode the expected name of the case category or case type with the following code block: # court_id can be any IL court, like \"adams\" or \"peoria\".categories = proxy_conn.get_case_categories(court_id, fileable_only=True, timing='Initial')for category in categories: if category['name'] == 'Adoption': tyler_category = category['code'] For things like party types, you'll want to ask the AL questions about roles first, i.e. user_ask_role.

If an address is an ALAddress, it has an address_fields() method that can be used inside a fields: code: | statement to insert a consistently formatted series of address fields. address_fields() will include an autocomplete method and is internationalized. Assembly Line question library questions use ALAddress objects for both the address and mailing_address attributes of people. Example: ---objects: - the_address: ALAddress---id: address questionsets: - the_address.address - the_address.cityquestion: | What is the address?fields: - code: | the_address.address_fields() See Addresses for more information and examples. note You must use sets with the address_fields() method. Otherwise Docassemble will not be able to find the block to provide a definition of the address fields. The address_fields() method includes the following optional parameters: country_code: if provided, will be used to control the list of states that is displayed as well as the default country in the country drop down. In the Assembly Line question library, country_code typically defaults to the value of AL_DEFAULT_COUNTRY default_state: default state, province, or sub locality. In the Assembly Line question library, default_state typically defaults to the value of AL_DEFAULT_STATE show_country: defaults to False. If enabled, a country drop down menu will be displayed. ALAddressList​ The ALAddressList class is a collection of ALAddresses. It is used to allow you to collect multiple addresses in one go and otherwise works exactly like the built-in Docassemble DAList object. The __str__() method of an ALAddressList has been modified so that using it displays a series of addresses on one line, separated by ;. This is used any place that Docassemble treats the variable as text, such as in a template, attachment block, or in a question or subquestion field. Example: ${ person.previous_addresses } might display 123 Main St, Boston, MA; 456 Broadway, Cambridge, MA.

It should be used to represent both natural people and businesses or other entities. ALIndividual objects include the following methods that are not in the stock Individual class: signature_if_final(i) is meant to be used inside a template or attachment block with the ALDocument class. It displays the signature if and only if i == 'final'. phone_numbers() displays either mobile_number, phone_number, or both if both are present for use in a PDF form with only one space to list phone numbers. contact_methods() displays a list of the contact methods the user provided in the default question library \"contact information\" screen as a formatted string. Specifically, it will display mobile_number, phone_number, email, and other_contact_method. This may be helpful in a formatted letter. age_in_years() returns the individual's age as an integer (whole number), calculated from the individual's birthdate attribute. formatted_age() is like age_in_years() but returns a formatted string with years, months, weeks, and days included when relevant. The cutoff is 2 weeks to display days, 2 years to display months, and anything over 2 years displays only years. name_fields(person_or_business:str = 'person', show_suffix=True) is like address_fields() and is used to display a list of either 3 or 4 fields for a person's name. See Names address_fields() is a wrapper around the address_fields() method of an ALAddress with the same parameters. gender_fields(show_help=False) is like the address_fields() method but displays a list of vetted gender options. Read more about gender questions. pronoun_fields() displays a question that allows the user to provide their pronouns, with multiple choice and a fill-in-the-blank option. See pronouns. initials() is used to return a string with the 1, 2, or 3 initial letters of a person's name. E.g., QKS for Quinten K Steenhuis. language_fields(choices=List[Dict[str, str]]) provides a language selector that sets the .language attribute of the user, together with an other fill-in. This should be the two-letter ISO language code. We recommend defining and passing a dictionary named al_language_user_choices which will also be used by built-in questions triggered from ql_baseline.yml. language_name() will return the language name in English. If there is a system-wide translation words.yml translation file and the user's interface is in that language, the language name will be translated. If the user selected an other option, the other option will be returned. Read-only attributes: The following are all read-only attributes you can use with PDF checkbox fields. They return True or False depending on the value of the gender attribute. gender_male gender_female gender_nonbinary gender_other (True if and only if the gender attribute is not \"female\" or \"male\") gender_unknown gender_self_described Relation to the Individual class​ The ALIndividual class inherits from Docassemble's Individual class, and all other methods of Individual work the same way as they do in the Individual class. ALPeopleList​ The ALPeopleList class is used to represent a group of people. Otherwise it works exactly like the built-in Docassemble DAList object. It also has the following additional methods: familiar() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with and joining the last two items familiar_or() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with or joining the last two items short_list(limit:int, truncate_string:str=', et. al.') returns a list that will be cut off at the limit provided. By default, , et. al. is appended. The text can be customized. note In the lists above, and and or can be translated using words.yml) Example: users.short_list(2) will display John Smith and Jane Smith, et. al. if the list contains John Smith, Jane Smith, and Jane Doe. et al is not used if the list is at or below the limit provided. Relation to the DAList class​ ALPeopleList inherits from Docassemble's DAList class, and retains all methods and attributes of a DAList. Specifically, the language methods, including the pronoun() and related methods, can be used to display the correct pronoun depending on the number and gender of the members of an ALPeopleList. E.g., users.pronoun_possessive() will return her if there is a single user with the gender attribute value \"female\", and their if there are multiple members of the list. These methods can be helpful inside single-language pleading templates but usually should not be used inside the interview itself, as they can make translation challenging. While there are language-specific versions of these methods, they can lead to odd ungrammatical \"fragments\". As tedious as it may be, the best practice for translation inside the interview is to use conditional logic for full sentences matching each gender and number.","s":"ALIndividual and ALPeopleList classes","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/algeneral","h":"#ALIndividual","p":591},{"i":600,"t":"Currently, the Assembly Line interviews provide these classes that you can use to target questions to a specific type of person: Tenant HousingAuthority Applicant Abuser Survivor Each class subclasses ALIndividual and shares its methods and attributes.

ALDocumentBundle objects can be nested to allow you to group multiple individual template files into one document that the user can download.

There are usually exactly two keys in the dictionary: preview and final, with the only difference being the presence or absence of a signature. Conditional logic inside the template or attachment block can be used to show or hide the signature depending on the value of the key so that the template does not need to be created twice. The signature_if_final method of an ALIndividual was created to simplify this common use case. Here's how to use an ALDocument: Create ALDocument objects in an objects block. Set any required attributes, like enabled, in the object block or in a separate code block. If you set enabled=True in the object block, your document will always be enabled. Define the key of the ALDocument in an attachment block using the variable name modifier. Usually, use one attachment block and define the variable name like this: variable name: some_al_document[i]. Optionally, reference the ALDocument inside an ALDocumentBundle.

Note that the enabled value is global for the interview session. If you want to use different logic in different bundles, you can easily create a separate ALDocument that references the same template file and attachment block.

Here's how to use an ALDocumentBundle: Create the ALDocumentBundle in an objects block. Add each ALDocument or nested ALDocumentBundle that your interview will sometimes produce to the bundle. Because the list is usually known in advance, it's common to include this in the object definition. Use the as_pdf() method on your preview screen to display a preview of the output without any signature. Use the download_list_html() and send_button_html() methods on your download screen. You can have as many or as few bundles as you would like. The Assembly Line convention is to use the following two bundles: al_user_bundle which should include a next steps document with instructions for your user al_court_bundle which leaves out the instructions and should have every document that you want the clerk to receive Stick with this convention if you expect to integrate with E-filing. Example: ---objects: - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[ssa_next_steps, letter]) - al_court_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[letter]) note You can nest ALDocumentBundles! Just create your bundle in a separate objects block and add it directly into the list of elements. This lets you create a document from multiple templates that you want the user to be able to open and print as one file. Attributes: enabled (optional): define this if the bundle is included inside another ALDocumentBundle. If other variables in your interview determine if it's enabled, you should define the attribute in a code block, like in this earlier example title: this is displayed on the download screen filename: used to construct the display filename for a pdf version of the bundle Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> DAFile: return a single concatenated PDF of the bundle's attachments as_zip(self, key:str = 'final', refresh:bool = True, title:str = '') -> DAFile: returns a compressed ZIP archive with separate documents for each item. enabled_documents(self, refresh:bool=True) -> List[Any]: return a list of only the \"enabled\" documents in the bundle as_flat_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: get_titles(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[str]: as_pdf_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: as_editable_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: download_list_html(self, key:str='final', format:str='pdf', view:bool=True refresh:bool=True, include_zip:bool = True, view_label=\"View\", view_icon:str=\"eye\", download_label:str=\"Download\", download_icon:str=\"download\", zip_label:str=None, zip_icon:str=\"file-archive\") -> str: returns HTML for a table with download and view buttons, as for a download screen send_button_html(self, key:str='final', show_editable_checkbox:bool = True)->str: send_email(self, to:any=None, key:str='final', editable:bool=False, template:any=None, **kwargs) -> bool: Example of a download screen that uses an ALDocumentBundle: ---progress: 100id: downloadevent: petition_to_change_name_of_adult_downloadquestion: | Your form is ready to download.subquestion: | Thank you ${ user_name_first_new }.

This tool helps you solve steps 3 and 4; users submitting feedback to you, and you being able to triage that feedback. Since much docassemble development already involves GitHub, the AssemblyLine uses GitHub's issues to handle and triage feedback. GitHub issues let you tag user feedback as such, link issues to PRs that fix the code, and track when the fix has been added to the code. GitHub is more developer focused, but it's a good tool to use if you don't currently track interview issues. The Feedback package started off focused on the GitHub workflow, but has since evolved to handle manual workflows that are less dependant on GitHub. If your organization has a different software system used to triage feedback, you'll have to write your own code to automatically integrate with it.","s":"Feedback Philosophy","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/github_feedback","h":"#feedback-philosophy","p":755},{"i":761,"t":"This how-to-guide will cover the simplest way to get feedback from an interview.

If you don't plan on using GitHub, we'll describe which of these Configuration options you can skip. In your docassemble Configuration, you'll add a github issues attribute, like the below: github issues: username: \"YOUR_NEW_DEDICATED_ISSUE_CREATION_ACCOUNT\" token: \"...\" # A valid GitHub personal access token associated with the username above default repository owner: YOUR_GITHUB_USER_OR_ORG_HERE allowed repository owners: # List the repo that your account will be allowed to create issues on - YOUR_GITHUB_USER_OR_ORG_HERE - SECOND_GITHUB_USER_OR_ORG feedback session linking: True ask panel: True If you want to automatically send all issues to GitHub, you need to have: username should be an account that you use to create GitHub issues. This should not be your primary GitHub account, as it is possible for other developers on the server to see this token and use it to preform actions as you. The MassAccess project uses the suffolklitlab-issues account to make issues, as seen in this example issue. token should be a GitHub personal access token associated with the user given in username. See the instruction for making a personal access token for more info. The feedback interview will save the feedback on the server with or without the above information, so you don't have to setup a GitHub account to get feedback from users. default repository owner should be your main GitHub organization or account that owns most of your interviews. For example, SuffolkLITLab, which owns MassAccess's repositories, and Illinois Legal Aid Online's GitHub account. allowed repository owners is optional, but necessary if your default repository owner doesn't own all of the repositories that you need to provide feedback for. If you want to be able to make issues on repositories from different organizations, you'll need to list each of them here. For example, Suffolk additionally hosts interviews made by MassLegalHelp. This is so users can't use your tool to spam issues on other organizations' GitHub repos. feedback session linking helps you as the server administrator debug tricky bugs. If this is set to True and if the user agrees, the feedback interview will save the session ID of their current interview on the server and link it to their feedback issue on github. This means that you can see the state of their interview when the user ran into their problem, making it easier to reproduce and fix their bug. You can browse the linked sessions in browse_feedback_sessions.yml. ask panel will add a question to the feedback interview, asking users if they want to be in a panel for user testing. If the user wants to be in a panel, it will ask for their email and save it in the server.

If you have more than one, only the last block will be used, which can be confusing. If you aren't using assembly_line.yml, you can add the two blocks below to add a footer to every page of your interview: ---modules: - docassemble.GithubFeedbackForm.github_issue---default screen parts: footer: | [:comment-dots: Feedback](${ feedback_link(user_info(), github_repo=YOUR_REPO_NAME) } ){:target=\"_blank\"} You can then start your interview, and select the Feedback link in the footer.

The final product of this guide will look like the below screenshot: This review information is stored only on the docassemble server, and isn't sent out to GitHub. First, find an interview you'd like to add a feedback widget to. Where exactly you want to ask for feedback is up to you, but we'd recommend doing it where a user has reached an end point. For this how-to, we'll make a short example interview from scratch. The entire interview is below: include: - docassemble.GithubFeedbackForm:embedded_review.yml---mandatory: Truequestion: | First screensubquestion: | Welcome to this example interview. ${ only_once_review_widget() } The key lines in the above are: adding docassemble.GithubFeedbackForm:embedded_review.yml to the include block.

If they answer the first question and refresh the screen or continue through the interview, the feedback widget won't be shown again, given that the user doesn't go back past the widget's screen in the interview. You can change several aspects of the review widget. For more information, see the API reference of review_widget in ALToolbox. That is the function only_once_review_widget is using. The only_once_review_widget review information is only stored on the docassemble server, and can be viewed using the feedback browsing interview.","s":"How to get reviews in an interview","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/github_feedback","h":"#how-to-get-reviews-in-an-interview","p":755},{"i":769,"t":"You can view feedback for all interviews on a server if you are logged in as an admin.

If the user agreed to provide you access to their full answers, you'll be able to see the session id, and have a button that lets you enter a shared session of that user's interview.

You will probably make major edits to the code here, changing the order and adding branching logic. set_parts(subtitle=str(users)) adds to the information a logged in user will see for this interview in their list of interviews.

Errors combining two branches, trouble merging, trouble combining, resolve merge conflicts, fixing merge conflicts between two branches, branches diverged Sometimes when you start to make a pull request, GitHub will tell you that you have a merge conflict. This means that while you were making changes to your branch, changes were also made to the branch you are trying to merge with and they changed the same lines of code. Git will not decide which bits of code to keep where - you have to decide that. These are unavoidable and a pain to deal with. Everyone runs into them now and again and they are tricky to resolve without introducing bugs. tip Ways to reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts: If possible, make the goals of your branches small so that you only make a few changes on a branch before making a pull request with it. Merge pull requests in the order they were made. Avoid editing the same sections of code at the same time. If you are working with collaborators, try to make sure you are working on tasks that do not edit the same lines. You can still make your pull request, but GitHub will prohibit merging. There are two ways GitHub might handle merge conflicts: GitHub allows you to 'resolve' the conflict in GitHub itself by editing the files in GitHub. GitHub is unable to help you resolve the issue (it doesn't offer the option). Either way, the most reliable way to deal with this situation is, unfortunately, to redo your changes on top of the new code: Make the pull request as usual, and use it as a tool. The changes you made will be highlighted in the file comparison tab. In docassemble create a new Project and pull in the other branch (the one you want to merge with).

But if you cannot find a matching label, use the general rules below to add as many custom labels as you need. Labels should be valid Python variable names that start with a letter​ PDF and DOCX labels should also work as valid Python variable names. The basic rule is that Python variable names need to start with a letter and can only contain letters, digits, and the _ underscore character. Some variable names are reserved and have a special meaning inside AssemblyLine interviews. You should not use a variable name on the reserved list. Doing so can lead to hard to track bugs. Variable names are case sensitive - make them all lowercase​ Field names are case sensitive. The convention is to never re-use variable names with different capitalizations to store different things. Stick with all lower case names for fields when possible. Use the Python snake_case format for field labels​ In PDFs, labels should be all one word, lowercase, with multiple words separated by an underscore, the _ character. This convention is called snake_case. Do not use a . symbol or [] inside a PDF field's label. In a DOCX file, you can use the . symbol as well as brackets [] but they have a special meaning. The . separates an object from its attribute, and the [] indicates that you are referencing a list of items. Beginners should avoid these symbols except when instructed to do so for one of the variable names below. Use short but descriptive labels​ Use variable names that are descriptive but also short. Avoid using abbreviations. A good rule of thumb is to spell out acronyms and initialisms for clarity, but to freely remove words other than nouns and verbs to keep the names short. Use a name you would still understand if you read it in a year. About 30 characters is a good limit to the length of a variable name. It's unusual to need more than that. If your variable name is shorter than 5 characters, it might not be descriptive enough. Some suggestions for coming up with custom labels​ There are no hard and fast rules other than the ones listed above, but here are some conventions that may help you: Drop words from the variable name that don't add specific meaning. Filler words like \"a\", \"the\", etc. are almost never needed. Stick with nouns and verbs. Yes/no variables (also called boolean) commonly start with a form of the verb \"to be\" or \"to have\", paired with a noun. E.g., is_attorney or has_notice_to_quit. You can also use other verbs--writes_docassemble or saved_status or wants_copies_returned. Do not include the type of variable in the variable name itself. It is usually redundant and is not a common Python style. Exception: you might add something like _list or _date that is both a type and is descriptive of the variable's real world contents. There are now a number of samples of interviews built with the Assembly Line framework that you can find online. You can get ideas for variable names to use in your interview that match if they apply to the same concepts. When you're stuck, feel free to ask for help! It's a good idea to get a second opinion the first few times you label a document. A fellow programmer may have some good ideas to make your variable names shorter, clearer, or more closely follow programming conventions.","s":"General rules for labels","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables","h":"#general-rules-for-labels","p":993},{"i":1003,"t":"We have identified common fields that exist in most paper court forms: names of people addresses information that identifies the court signatures dates currency figures a pair of yes/no checkboxes docket numbers or court filing numbers We came up with a convention to identify the roles that people may play in relation to your form: The \"user\" of the form: the person who the form is being filed for, making a request or response to the court The \"other_party\" of the form: the person who the user is responding to or suing We have also identified some common names for people that appear across many forms. By using the labels for fields that we selected, you will be able to use the questions that we have vetted and pre-written without needing to write them from scratch.

The Docassemble and DOCX variable name users[0] is the equivalent of users or users1 in a PDF label. users[1] is the equivalent of user2. Names are not transformed at all when you work in a DOCX template.

Defaults to \"job\". WARNING - Individual items in .to_add and .to_subtract should not be used directly. They should only be accessed through the filtering methods of this job. Fulfills these requirements: A job can be hourly. Its wages will be calculated with that in mind. Despite an hourly job, some individual items must be calculated using the job's whole period. Some items will have their own periods. In a list of jobs, a developer may need to access full time and part time jobs separately. In a list of jobs, a developer may need to sum all items from one source, such as tips or taxes. The developer needs access to total money coming in, total money going out, and the total of money going in and money coming out. A user must be able to add their own arbitrary items. total​ def total(times_per_year: float = 1, source: Optional[SourceType] = None, exclude_source: Optional[SourceType] = None) -> Decimal Alias for ALItemizedJob.gross_total to integrate with ALIncomeList math. gross_total​ def gross_total(times_per_year: float = 1, source: Optional[SourceType] = None, exclude_source: Optional[SourceType] = None) -> Decimal Returns the sum of positive values (payments) for a given times_per_year.

Defaults to False. input_width int, optional - The width of the input field or display area, used for determining overflow. Defaults to 80. overflow_message str, optional - Message indicating overflow in the safe value. Defaults to \"\". preserve_words bool, optional - If True, ensures words are not split between the main content and the overflow. Defaults to True. Returns: Any - The portion of the variable exceeding the content safe for display, considered as overflow. max_lines​ def max_lines(input_width: int = 80) -> int Compute the maximum number of lines that can fit in the input given the specified input width. Arguments: input_width int, optional - The width of the input or display area. Defaults to 80.

Defaults to 80. preserve_newlines bool - Determines whether newlines are preserved in the \"safe\" text. Defaults to False, which means all newlines are removed. This allows more text to appear before being sent to the addendum. _original_value Any - for speed reasons, you can provide the full text and just use this method to determine if the overflow trigger is exceeded. If no _original_value is provided, this method will determine it using the value_if_defined() method. preserve_words bool - If True, the algorithm will try to preserve whole words when truncating the text.

If the value is not defined, return an empty string. When preserve_newlines is True, the output will be limited to a number of lines, not a number of characters. The max number of lines will be calculated as floor(self.overflow_trigger/input_width). Therefore, it is important that input_width is a divisor of overflow_trigger. Whitespace will be altered. If preserve_newlines is true, the return value may have newlines, but double newlines and Windows style (rn) will be replaced with n. Double spaces will be replaced with a single space. If preserve_newlines is false, all whitespace, including newlines and tabs, will be replaced with a single space.

Returns: Union[str, List[Any]]: The portion of the variable that fits within the overflow trigger. value_if_defined​ def value_if_defined() -> Any Fetch the value of the designated field if it exists; otherwise, return an empty string. This method ensures that the addendum does not inadvertently trigger docassemble's variable gathering. Returns: Any - The value of the field if it exists, otherwise an empty string. __str__​ def __str__() Represent the ALAddendumField instance as a string. Returns: str - The string representation of the value contained within the field. columns​ def columns(skip_empty_attributes: bool = True, skip_attributes: Optional[set] = None) -> Optional[list] Return a list of the attributes present within the object that would make sense to go in the table of an addendum. If the headers attribute exists, this will be prioritized. Otherwise, the method will infer columns from the first value in the list. Empty attributes and the complete attribute are typically ignored. Arguments: skip_empty_attributes bool, optional - Determines whether empty attributes are included in the list. Defaults to True. skip_attributes Optional[set], optional - A set of attributes to ignore. Defaults to {\"complete\"}. Returns: Optional[list] - A list of columns or None if no meaningful columns can be determined. Notes: The \"location\" attribute of an Address object is always skipped in the column list. type​ def type() -> str Determine the data type of the contained value. Categories: 'list': A simple list. 'object_list': A list containing dictionaries or objects. 'other': Any other type. Returns: str - The type category of the value. is_list​ def is_list() -> bool Check if the field contains a list value, whether it consists of objects, dictionaries, or standard values. Returns: bool - True if the field contains a list, otherwise False. is_object_list​ def is_object_list() -> bool Determine if the field contains a list of dictionaries or objects. Returns: bool - True if the field contains a list of dictionaries or objects, otherwise False. overflow_markdown​ def overflow_markdown() -> str Generate a markdown representation of the overflow values. The method returns either a markdown table or a bulleted list based on the structure of the values. This utility offers a standardized way to represent overflow content, though users might prefer to manually control the output's format. Returns: str - A markdown representation of the overflow values. overflow_docx​ def overflow_docx( path: str = \"docassemble.ALDocumentDict:data/templates/addendum_table.docx\") -> Any Insert a formatted table into a docx file, representing the overflow values. This method provides a convenient way to add overflow content into a docx file, although it doesn't offer formatting control. If more formatting flexibility is required, consider directly fetching the overflow values using the overflow_value() method. Arguments: path str, optional - Path to the template docx file to be used. Defaults to a predetermined path. Returns: A docx template with the inserted table.","s":"ALAddendumField Objects","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/reference/AssemblyLine/al_document","h":"#aladdendumfield-objects","p":1258},{"i":1263,"t":"class ALAddendumFieldDict(DAOrderedDict) A specialized dictionary for managing fields that may overflow in a document.

Typically there are three: The final version of a document with a signature. E.g., my_doc['final']. The preview version of a document with no signature. E.g., my_doc['preview']. An addendum of a document contained in the attribute addendum. E.g. my_doc.addendum. There is no limit to the number of keys, but the ALDocumentBundle class expects at least a \"final\" key to exist, and the addendum attribute is required if you desire to use PDF documents with text overflow. It is best practice to use exactly the two keys \"final\" and \"preview\" and the attribute \"addendum\". The \"final\" and \"preview\" documents will normally be the same template, but with logic controlling the display of a particular section, such as the signature. Each form that an interview generates should get its own ALDocument object. The \"addendum\" attribute can be handled in a generic object block. Multiple documents can use the same addendum template, with just the case caption varying. ALDocuments are designed to be used contingently as part of ALDocumentBundle objects. Each ALDocument is considered to be \"enabled\" or \"disabled\" for a particular interview user's session. This allows you to always work with a single object representing all of the possible documents an interview can generate, and use encapsulated logic to trigger individual documents inclusion on the final download screen. Attributes: filename str - name used for output PDF title str - display name for the output PDF enabled bool - if this document should be created. See examples. addendum DAFile | DAFileCollection - (optional) an attachment block overflow_fields ALAddendumField - (optional) ALAddendumFieldDict instance. These values will be used to detect and handle overflow. has_addendum bool - (optional) Defaults to False. Set to True if the document could have overflow, like for a PDF template. Notes: The enabled attribute should always be defined by a code block or the objects block, because by default it is considered fresh on each page load. If your interview logic requires that you directly ask the user whether or not to include a document, you can use a single intermediate variable that is posed to the interview user to work around this limitation.
