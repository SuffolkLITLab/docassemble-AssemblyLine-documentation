We don't want to burden the user, but also don't want the user forget to list any significant expenses they would have that could prove financial burden. What expenses you want to initially ask about will depend on your community's needs. For example, if your community lives in northern rural areas, they might have alternative heating needs, like wood or oil, and might not immediately associate those costs with standard \"utilities\". If your community is in a flood plain, you might want to include flood insurance as an option.","s":"Guiding Philosophy","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alincome/expenses","h":"#guiding-philosophy","p":45},{"i":51,"t":"If you want to jump right in, check out a live demo of the ALExpense feature. ALExpense is a class that represents an amount that re-occurs periodically, like a monthly utility bill, or weekly grocery expenses. It has a few attributes: expense.value is the actual amount that is reoccurring. For example, someone's rental insurance might always be $50 each month. expense.times_per_year is the number of times each year that this amount occurs. If someone has to pay their landlord twice a month, times_per_year would be 24. This value can also be fractional if need be; an expense that only needs to be paid once every two years would have a times_per_year of 0.5. expense.source is the source, or name, of the expense. Food expenses could have a source of \"food\". expense.display_name is the name of the source that you want to display to the user. This helps with multi-lingual interviews, where you can show the user the name of the expense, but your interview logic can still refer to a single canonical language name. It also helps add or change additional context to the name that you don't want to write out in your interview logic. For example, expense.source could be \"medical insurance\", but expense.display_name could be \"Medical Insurance (including health, dental, and vision)\". You won't be using ALExpense by itself often though; you'll need a list of expenses from the user, which we'll discuss next.","s":"ALExpense","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alincome/expenses","h":"#alexpense","p":45},{"i":53,"t":"Let's make a short interview that just asks for someone's expenses.

For each expense that the user said they have, there will be one question screen, asking for how often they pay for that expense, and how much they pay.

An advantage of Google Analytics and Segment is that the data will be stored for the long term and you do not need to worry about persisting it between server outages or upgrades, nor about retaining information long term on your server. A disadvantage is that they rely on well-known user tracking tools that may be blocked by ad-blocking or other security software, so the usage statistics may not be completely accurate.

Example: id: this is the google or segment analytics idquestion: | What is your namefields: - Name: user_name Sign up for Google Analytics or Segment, and follow the Docassemble documentation to enable tracking with the system of your choice. This integration allows for very basic tracking. You can identify popular interviews, screens, and dropoff points. Perhaps the most important thing to track is to assign an id named download to your download screen. Then, inside Google Analytics, you can search for the keyword \"download\" under Behavior | Site Content | All pages.

The default stores only the zip code, but if you remove all parameters, the user's full interview session will be captured in a simplified state.

Plan your launch strategy early, and budget at least a few weeks here. Our work has a built-in landing page: courtformsonline.org. Think about your landing page. A Docassemble interview is not indexable by Google, so you should have a static site, perhaps in Wordpress or another technology you already use, to highlight and direct someone to your app. Excellent examples include: Illinois Legal Aid Online, example landing page Washington Law Help, example landing page Also consider building relationships with peers and organizations in control of content. For an access to justice project (non-commercial) you will want to build relationships directly with your regional legal help website, courts, cities, and governmental partners to get direct links to your landing page on their relevant self-help guides. Consider direct outreach to potential repeat users of your app. For a tool focused on domestic violence, building an ongoing relationship with victims advocates in the police department, legal aid, and domestic violence shelters, for example, will lead to many more users of your app than any approach to reaching consumers directly. Hopefully, most of your consumers will be one-time users. Advocates will use it again and again. This direct outreach should be sustained over time. You can monitor analytics and referrals to understand where your users are coming from and where to concentrate your outreach. Consider if you have a budget and willingness to experiment with direct acquisition of consumers via: paid advertising creating and sharing a promo, bus ad, or other materials that may be free advertising sources posting flyers gaining earned media (it helps to have a partner like a city or university here!)","s":"Launching your product","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/assembly_line_steps/planning_time","h":"#launching-your-product","p":76},{"i":88,"t":"It's common for one or more roles to be shared by a single person.

Think about finding people to play the following roles: Project manager Researcher and content author Subject matter expert and liaison to subject matter expert Template cleanup and adding labeled fields (in Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word) Python coder Frontend / HTML / CSS / JavaScript coders Docassemble developer Plain language reviewer and editor Tester We found the most success in asking short-term volunteers to help with testing, cleaning up and adding labeled fields to templates, and Python and frontend coding (for discrete tasks that didn't demand too much familiarity with our whole code base). Subject matter experts, similarly, did not require a long-term commitment to the project, but did require some orientation to understand what an interactive legal application can and should do. Longer-term members of our team fit more naturally into other roles. People often changed roles and overlapped them over the time that they volunteered. For example: almost all of our members did some Docassemble development as they gained comfort and familiarity as the project went on. Project management is a learned skill that fit well with people who were outgoing and organized, and also did not demand extensive coding experience. We found it necessary to have a project manager role to make sure content actually got out the door. Otherwise, apps could spend too much time in the refining stage. The urgency of the pandemic helped us center delivering working apps as a goal. While not an explicit role in the project, we also found it important to share our work in progress with community groups and stakeholder groups early to gain important insights about features and how our project should be designed. Often, this was in the form of a demo with an explicit ask for feedback, so at the stage a bit beyond the useful prototype stage.","s":"Roles","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/assembly_line_steps/roles","h":"","p":87},{"i":90,"t":"info This pages is about the bootcamp that we ran from February 18th, 2021 to March 11th, 2021.

Using them, it doesn't matter what order you use to list your fields or what order your pages come in. It also doesn't matter if you include extra fields accidentally. They are a snapshot of the user who's filling out the form for that test. Example: And I get to the question id \"has sink\" with this data: | var | value | trigger | | last_haircut_date | today - 730 | last_haircut_date | | wants_virtual_haircut | True | wants_virtual_haircut | | scissors[i].length | 2 | scissors[0].length | | scissors[i].length | 7 | scissors[1].length | You can write a story table that goes all the way through your interview, or a story table that only goes part way. Very basically, you tell the story table Step what question you want to get to and the variables and values it will need to get there. Whenever the test gets to a page, it checks your story table for any variables that match a variable on the page. When it finds a match, it sets the value of the field. When it's done with a page, it continues to the next page until it reaches the terminal question. You can have multiple tables in one Scenario and you can put other steps between story table Steps. danger A story table Step must not be the first step in your Scenario.

Run your interview manually until you reach the page you want the story table to get to. Open the \"source\" display of the interview. Currently, that looks like angle brackets, </>, in the header of the page. Note the id of the page. Tap the \"Show variables and values\" button. It will open a new tab showing a big JSON object.

Given I wait 120 seconds When I start the interview at \"yaml_file_name.yml\" This Step can also be used anywhere in your scenario to wait between Steps.

Other parts of web accessibility involve writing the interview in a way that the user's browser and other accessibility tools (like screen readers) can understand. Docassemble handles many of these things for you, but there are some parts that you'll have to address when writing your interview.

In docassemble, you should set the alt_text attribute of a DAFile, or use the set_alt_text() function. If you are writing HTML directly, you can add an alt property to any img tags you use (see below). <img src=\"my_image.png\" alt=\"A drawing of a flowchart: the question is 'do you have any children?', the option 'yes' leads to 'scenario 1', and the option 'no' leads to 'scenario 2'.\"/>","s":"Use alt-text with images","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/coding_style_guide/accessibility","h":"#use-alt-text-with-images","p":246},{"i":253,"t":"You should add alt-text to your organizations logo.

The glossary terms feature should be used cautiously, perhaps with additional CSS to make it more distinctive. The risk with this feature is distracting or confusing users.

Litigants answer questions and follow instructions on forms as well as reading words.

Using bootstrap.build is the simplest option for most authors. Visit the bootstrap.build website. Click the button to open the Builder Customize the options that you want to customize. Typically those will include: Under color system, the $gray/$blue/etc. colors, if you use a matching color in your theme Under color system, almost always the variables primary, secondary, success, info, warning, danger, light and dark Under Typography, customize any fonts that you wish to use Under forms, you may want to customize button size and rounded edges Click the \"export theme\" button (it may be hidden behind a banner at the top of the page) and choose the \"bootstrap.min.css\" option. Rename this theme to be more specific. Optionally, download the _variables.scss file so that you can easily load and adjust your settings in future. Add this theme to your Docassemble playground using the Folders | Static menu. Next, you will need to make a small adjustment to the theme generated by bootstrap.build.

If you prefer more control over building the theme, you can create a custom theme from the bootstrap source code. The Bootstrap documentation covers the details of theming if you want to take this approach. Create a new custom.scss file anywhere on your computer to contain the SASS/CSS styles for your branding. Detailed instructions on what this file can contain are in the Bootstrap documentation. You can use a color theme generator like Huemint.com to make sure that you have a consistent set of all 9 Bootstrap variables. When you use the color theme generator, at the bottom of the page, you will see a small snippet of code that you can copy into the customs.scss file. For example, your new custom.scss might look like this: // Custom.scss// Option A: Include all of Bootstrap// Include any default variable overrides here (though functions won't be available)$white: #ffffff;$theme-colors: ( \"light\": #d8e2a5, \"dark\": #1b1b1b, \"primary\": #25dec6, \"secondary\": #375b5a, \"info\": #d74d72, \"success\": #0cb545, \"warning\": #f4ca0b, \"danger\": #fa043c,);// Note: we placed our custom.scss file in the bootstrap path for simplicity,// so we use a different path than in the bootstrap documentation// @import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";@import \"bootstrap\";// Then add additional custom code here Once you have written your custom.scss file, you can use the ALDashboard (which you can install on your docassemble server) to compile a custom Bootstrap theme. If you are associated with the Suffolk LITLab and have an account on the Suffolk Development server, you can visit a live version of the tool to try it out. At the end of the tool, download the compiled file, and then add it a docassemble project, in the static folder. You can then reference your new file by adding a bootstrap theme feature to your interview: features: bootstrap theme: my_bootstrap_theme.css Running node and npm to build a Bootstrap config (optional)​ If you don't have access to a docassemble server yourself, you can also compile a bootstrap theme from source using node and npm. Use a computer with a current version of Node. The instructions on this page assume you are using an Ubuntu Linux computer with Node installed, but they should be the same on any workstation. They were tested on a machine running Windows 11 with Ubuntu running under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It also assumes that you have VS Code installed, but you can use any text editor of your choice. First, download the Bootstrap source, and install its dependencies. As of this writing, the latest version you should use is 5.1.3. wget https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v5.1.3/bootstrap-5.1.3-dist.zipunzip bootstrap-5.1.3-dist.zipcd bootstrap-5.1.3npm install Place the custom.scss file you wrote from the above section in the unzipped bootstrap-5.1.3 folder, and use npm to compile the theme file. cd ~/bootstrap-5.1.3npm run css-compile Your new custom.css file is in the ~/bootstrap-5.1.3/dist/css directory.

Once you have a .woff file, upload it to the /static folder of a Docassemble playground. Add an @font-face directive to your bootstrap.css file (or a separate CSS file that you reference in the features block of your interview) You cannot include Mako tags in your CSS file, so in order to use the new font face, you should add it to a Docassemble package and then install the package on your server.

If you need to check the value of multiple variables in one if statement, you need to use the more complex js show if. When you use js show if, you need to use a JavaScript expression that uses the function val() at least once. val() is a JavaScript function that returns the value of a variable name that is visible on screen. It takes the name of the Docassemble variable in quotes as its only parameter. Here is a small example of a js show if expression: ---id: Tell me more about Respondentquestion: | Tell me more about the ${ other_parties[0] }.fields: - Is ${ other_parties[0] } employed?: other_parties[0].is_employed datatype: yesnoradio - Is ${ other_parties[0] } a parent of your child?: other_parties[0].joint_parent datatype: yesnoradio - ${ other_parties[0] }'s monthly income: other_parties[0].income datatype: currency js show if: | val(\"other_parties[0].is_employed\") && val(\"other_parties[0].joint_parent\") Check the js show if documentation to learn how to use different combinations of values in a js show if expression. The key is that you'll use ordinary JavaScript keywords to do any comparisons. JavaScript is its own language, and keywords such as \"or\", \"and\" and even \"==\" work slightly differently, as explained in the Docassemble documentation. You can also use a general resource that documents JavaScript to learn more.","s":"Adding conditional logic on an individual screen","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/customizing_interview","h":"#adding-conditional-logic-on-an-individual-screen","p":418},{"i":434,"t":"If you would like to make the display of a variable in the attachment conditional, you can use a multi-line Mako statement right inside the attachment block: attachment: variable name: my_document[i] pdf template file: my_document.pdf fields: - \"signature\": | % if i == \"final\": ${ users.signature } % endif It is a good habit to use these multi-line blocks so that the logic is easy to read and understand later.

These label rules work like that too - you'll combine prefixes and suffixes to build your labels, so look out for that pattern: prefix_suffix Note: Every field label in a PDF has to be unique. They cannot be repeated. We'll talk more about that later, but it's good to remember.

In a form that creates a new case, the user of the form is always going to be the plaintiff or petitioner.","s":"Figure out who is using your form","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/document_variables","h":"#figure-out-who-is-using-your-form","p":444},{"i":455,"t":"Label parties to the case with party-specific labels​ The person who is using your form and the person who your form's user is opposing should always get one of the special labels below: Note: We made PDF labels singular because you can't work with lists in many PDF editors. DOCX variables representing people are all plural. Internally, all variables representing people are plural. PDF label DOCX label Use case user users, user[0], or user[n] (where n is any whole number; use sequentially Will display the full name of the person who is filling out the online form other_party other_parties, other_parties[0], or other_parties[n] The person suing or being sued by the person filling out the form; someone on the \"other side\" of the case. plaintiff plaintiffs, plaintiffs[0], plaintiffs[n] Plaintiff in the case if we don't know if the plaintiff is the user or other party. defendant defendants, defendants[0], defendants[n] Defendant in the case if we don't know if the defendant is the user or other party. petitioner petitioners, petitioners[0], petitioners[n] Petitioner in the case if we don't know if the petitioner is the user or other party. respondent respondents, respondents[0], respondents[n] Plaintiff in the case if we don't know if the plaintiff is the user or other party. If the form has room for two people on one side of the case, you can reference user1 and user2 (on a PDF) or users[0] and users[1] (in a DOCX). It's important to always use one of these 4 labels for people who are actually part of the case, since we use those internally in many many places in our standard questions and to communicate information to the court. Never use names like: Tenant Landlord Parent etc. that can be converted into party labels, like Plaintiff or Defendant, if the form is being used by the tenant or landlord or parent. Every form should have at least one of the 6 party labels above. It's best to use user/users and other_party/other_parties when you know that the form is always used by a plaintiff or defendant. For example, a form that is always used by a tenant in an eviction case will normally get labeled with user/users any place that the form mentions either tenant or defendant. In any form that starts a new case, we can always label the PDF with user where the plaintiff name goes. Use one of these exact prefixes for other \"people\" on the form when at all possible​ You may want to use other kinds of labels on the form for miscellaneous people who are associated with the form, but are not parties to the case. Using one of these labels below that we have pre-selected tells our tool that these are people, so we can handle things like addresses, birth dates, etc. correctly. We can freely add more labels to this list if you need them for your form. Ideally, talk to us about that before running your form through the weaver. Never use any of the labels below when the person identified by the label is a party to the case. For example, if they are the person using the form or the person who is on the opposing side of the case from the user of the form. PDF label DOCX label Use case spouse spouses, spouses[0], spouses[n] A spouse whose information goes on the form but is not a party to the case. child children, children[0], children[n] Any child whose information goes on the form. parent parents, parents[0], parents[n] A parent who is not a party to the case. guardian guardians, guardians[0], guardians[n] A guardian who is not a party to the case. caregiver caregivers guardian_ad_litem guardians_ad_litem attorney attorneys translator translators witness witnesses debt_collector debt_collectors creditor creditors These are are considered the prefixes we described before. unknown_role isn't something our program will account for, but it's a name you can use when you don't know what role name to use. It can remind you (or alert other folks) to get a consult from someone who would know more. People suffixes​ When these are people, they have similar things we want to record about them. For example, their first name (name_first). These will be our suffixes. When a field is for a plaintiff's first name, you will combine the two: plaintiff_name_first. These are pre-defined words you can use as field labels for a plaintiff: Label to use in the PDF When to use it plaintiff Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's full name plaintiff_name The same - label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's full name plaintiff_name_first Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's first name plaintiff_name_middle Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's middle name plaintiff_name_last Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's last name plaintiff_name_suffix Label for a field that asks for the suffix of the plaintiff's name plaintiff_gender Label for a text field asking for the plaintiff to write in their gender plaintiff_gender_female Label for a checkbox for a \"female\" gender choice plaintiff_gender_male Label for a checkbox for a \"male\" gender choice plaintiff_birthdate Label for a single field for the plaintiff's date of birth CONTACT INFORMATION plaintiff_address_address Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's house address plaintiff_address_unit Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's apartment number (deprecated) plaintiff_address_street Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's house address. Use plaintiff_address_address instead (deprecated) plaintiff_address_street2 Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's apartment number. Use plaintiff_address_unit instead plaintiff_address_city Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's city address plaintiff_address_state Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's state plaintiff_address_zip Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's zip code plaintiff_email Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's email address plaintiff_phone Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's phone number SIGNATURE What if you need to use a field again, though? As we said, each field label in a PDF needs to be unique, but some forms ask for a field multiple times. For example, the plaintiff's name might come up more than once. In those cases, you add two underscores (__) and a number. This will go on the very end of the label, after all the suffixes. So, prefix_suffix__2, prefix_suffix__3, and so on: Label to use in the PDF When to use it plaintiff_name_first__2 Label for the second field that asks for that plaintiff's first name plaintiff_name_first__3 Label for the third field that asks for that plaintiff's first name plaintiff__2 Label for the second field that asks for that plaintiff's full name plaintiff__3 Label for the third field that asks for that plaintiff's full name And so on. How about the other person/organization types you told me about? All these pre-defined suffixes work the same for all of the person/organization types we listed.

Also, we can do some automation with custom labels too if they follow certain patterns. Important Rules​ Some things you really need to do or it will be very hard to write code for the labels: Field names must start with a letter or underscore (_) - not a number or anything else. Field names can only include letters, numbers, and underscores. No spaces or any other character. When you run across a large area that gives room for writing a paragraph, make sure it's one big field. Useful label conventions​ Code is also about communicating with each other. The label names you come up with now are ones people will need to work with in the future. You don't have to do too much, but try not to label things with Adobe's defaults or field1, field2, and so on. Here are some suggestions for making helpful labels: Please use all lowercase letters for all labels. The coders will really appreciate it. Separate multiple words in a label with an underscore: plaintiff_does_love_pie Make the labels descriptive. If they can be descriptive and short, that's even better. Avoid acronyms and abbreviations, other than very common ones such as id for identification. When you have several related fields in a row, it could help with automation if you make your own prefix and suffixes. Make a prefix out of the the feature that groups them together, e.g. asset_checking, asset_savings, etc. It makes alphabetical sorting easier. Additional suffixes to help with automation: Use verb/noun pairs for checkboxes. For example, plaintiff_is_parent, defendant_speaks_spanish, petitioner_has_assets, etc. For checkboxes with a yes/no pair, add _yes and _no to the end as an extra suffix. E.g., defendant_knows_english_yes and defendant_knows_english_no - prefix_suffix_suffix","s":"Custom field labels","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/document_variables","h":"#custom-field-labels","p":444},{"i":465,"t":"Thank you for joining us to help make a difference in people's lives!","s":"Thank you!","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/document_variables","h":"#thank-you","p":444},{"i":467,"t":"Again, don't try to memorize these.

To keep it simple, the interview will only file one type of case; this lets us hardcode a few pieces of information in our interview. We'll first need to find the right \"codes\" for our interview. Tyler's E-filing system defines specific codes for many different parts of the filing process, include the over-arching category of the case, the more specific case type, and even things like whether or not the filed document should be confidential or not. To find the right codes, navigate through the URLs provided by visiting https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes. Firefox will display clickable links that you can use to browse the different codes. For example, say we want to write an Adoption interview. The codes in Illinois are split by courts, so to see the case categories available to one particular court, say Adams, we can go to https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/categories, and scroll through the responses until we find the \"Adoption\" entry, code 7306. We would then see the case types for Adoption cases in adams at https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/case_types?category_id=7306&timing=Initial, which is 25361. The endpoints should say when they need parameters, like we provided with category_id=7306&timing=Initial above. We are currently working on a better interface for finding and handling these codes at runtime based on our experiences in Illinois and Massachusetts. Stay tuned. For this guide, we'll stick with a single court, to make things simple to understand.

The metadata can include things like a case number, the names of parties, and codes that tell a clerk what kind of filing is being delivered. E-filing replaces delivering documents to the court by hand, mail, or courier. Traditionally, e-filing requires visiting a dedicated web page, creating an account, converting documents into PDF format, and then inputting a lot of confusing information, such as document type, filing codes, and court codes. The LIT Lab's primary tool is code that guided interview authors can incorporate to add a simple one-click e-file button into an existing guided interview. The interview author can pre-select or help the litigant select the proper codes. This removes the most challenging part of traditional e-filing. If the litigant qualifies for a fee waiver, they may not even be required to create an account. We have also created a very simple e-filing \"portal\" that works much like traditional e-filing websites. This is not a product we expect end-users to interact with just yet. There are many competing systems of e-filing, but often there is a monopoly vendor within a given jurisdiction. Often, the vendor may have a program that allows third-parties to deliver documents to the vendor. Then, the vendor takes care of delivering the document the rest of the way to the court's docket. If you think of the e-filing vendor as a corporate mail room, then third-party vendors like the Suffolk LIT Lab are the equivalent of UPS or FedEx. We just get the document to the building. The e-filing vendor handles getting it to the right desk.

ALDocumentBundle objects can be nested to allow you to group multiple individual template files into one document that the user can download. Both ALDocument and ALDocumentBundle objects can be either enabled or not.

There are usually exactly two keys in the dictionary: preview and final, with the only difference being the presence or absence of a signature. Conditional logic inside the template or attachment block can be used to show or hide the signature depending on the value of the key so that the template does not need to be created twice. The signature_if_final method of an ALIndividual was created to simplify this common use case. Here's how to use an ALDocument: Create ALDocument objects in an objects block. Set any required attributes, like enabled, in the object block or in a separate code block. Define the key of the ALDocument in an attachment block using the variable name modifier. Usually, use one attachment block and define the variable name like this: variable name: some_al_document[i]. Optionally, reference the ALDocument inside an ALDocumentBundle. Example: ---objects: - letter: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"ssa_letter\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False)---attachment: - pdf template file: ssa_letter.pdf variable name: letter[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } Example: It's common in longer interviews to have the enabled attribute be defined in a code block, like this: ---objects: - main_document: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"main_document\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False) - insurance_rider: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"rider\", has_addendum=False)---attachments: - pdf template file: main_document.pdf variable name: main_document[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } - pdf template file: rider.pdf variable name: rider[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) }---code: | if total_cost > 1000: insurance_rider.enabled = True else: insurance_rider.enabled = False # or more concise but slightly harder to read: # insurance_rider.enabled = total_cost > 1000 In the example above, the insurance_rider document is only included in any bundles if the total cost of the project is over $1,000. Note that the enabled value is global for the interview session. If you want to use different logic in different bundles, you can easily create a separate ALDocument that references the same template file and attachment block. Attributes: filename: the display filename used for the document when it is downloaded title: the title shown on the download screen enabled: whether the document should be \"turned on\" when it is referenced in an ALDocumentBundle addendum: points to a variable representing an attachment block with a formatted addendum. The Assembly Line provides a good default addendum template that is flexible enough to work with many fields. overflow_fields: an ALAddendumFieldDict with each representing a field that has potential to be sent to the addendum if exceeds a pre-set length. has_addendum : set this to True or False to control whether the overflow_fields dictionary will be checked to decide whether or not to generate an addendum file. Optional; defaults to False. Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a PDF version of the completed template and any addendum. key is normally preview or final as_docx(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a DOCX version of the completed template and any addendum if the original is a DOCX template. key is normally preview or final. as_list(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a 1 or 2 item list which contains the template and its addendum, if any. need_addendum(): returns True if the addendum exists and there are overflow fields. has_overflow(): returns True if there are fields that trigger the addendum. overflow(): returns a list of just the fields that triggered the addendum. safe_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"safe\" value of field_name (the amount that is less than overflow_trigger) plus an overflow message. Used in an attachment block. overflow_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"unsafe\" value of field_name--the amount that exceeds the overflow_trigger.

Here's how to use an ALDocumentBundle: Create the ALDocumentBundle in an objects block. Add each ALDocument or nested ALDocumentBundle that your interview will sometimes produce to the bundle. Because the list is usually known in advance, it's common to include this in the object definition. Use the as_pdf() method on your preview screen to display a preview of the output without any signature. Use the download_list_html() and send_button_html() methods on your download screen. You can have as many or as few bundles as you would like. The Assembly Line convention is to use the following two bundles: al_user_bundle which should include a next steps document with instructions for your user al_court_bundle which leaves out the instructions and should have every document that you want the clerk to receive Stick with this convention if you expect to integrate with E-filing. Example: ---objects: - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[ssa_next_steps, letter]) - al_court_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[letter]) note You can nest ALDocumentBundles!

You can add your own template for the individual cover pages for each document, too. Use the stock cover page template as a model. By default, exhibits are labeled sequentially as A, B, and so on. You can supply your own method for labeling each exhibit by defining the auto_labeler attribute of the your_document.exhibits object to be a Python function that accepts an integer and returns a string. The default labeler is just the Docassemble function alpha.

The __str__() method of an ALAddressList has been modified so that using it displays a series of addresses on one line, separated by ;. This is used any place that Docassemble treats the variable as text, such as in a template, attachment block, or in a question or subquestion field.

It displays the signature if and only if i == 'final'. phone_numbers() displays either mobile_number, phone_number, or both if both are present for use in a PDF form with only one space to list phone numbers. contact_methods() displays a list of the contact methods the user provided in the default question library \"contact information\" screen as a formatted string. Specifically, it will display mobile_number, phone_number, email, and other_contact_method. This may be helpful in a formatted letter. age_in_years() returns the individual's age as an integer (whole number), calculated from the individual's birthdate attribute. formatted_age() is like age_in_years() but returns a formatted string with years, months, weeks, and days included when relevant. The cutoff is 2 weeks to display days, 2 years to display months, and anything over 2 years displays only years. name_fields(person_or_business:str = 'person', show_suffix=True) is like address_fields() and is used to display a list of either 3 or 4 fields for a person's name. See Names address_fields() is a wrapper around the address_fields() method of an ALAddress with the same parameters. gender_fields(show_help=False) is like the address_fields() method but displays a list of vetted gender options. Read more about gender questions. initials() is used to return a string with the 1, 2, or 3 initial letters of a person's name. E.g., QKS for Quinten K Steenhuis. language_fields(choices=List[Dict[str, str]]) provides a language selector that sets the .language attribute of the user, together with an other fill-in. This should be the two-letter ISO language code. We recommend defining and passing a dictionary named al_language_user_choices which will also be used by built-in questions triggered from ql_baseline.yml. language_name() will return the language name in English. If there is a system-wide translation words.yml translation file and the user's interface is in that language, the language name will be translated. If the user selected an other option, the other option will be returned. Read-only attributes: The following are all read-only attributes you can use with PDF checkbox fields.

It also has the following additional methods: familiar() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with and joining the last two items familiar_or() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with or joining the last two items short_list(limit:int, truncate_string:str=', et. al.') returns a list that will be cut off at the limit provided. By default, , et. al. is appended.

Relation to the DAList class​ ALPeopleList inherits from Docassemble's DAList class, and retains all methods and attributes of a DAList. Specifically, the language methods, including the pronoun() and related methods, can be used to display the correct pronoun depending on the number and gender of the members of an ALPeopleList. E.g., users.pronoun_possessive() will return her if there is a single user with the gender attribute value \"female\", and their if there are multiple members of the list. These methods can be helpful inside single-language pleading templates but usually should not be used inside the interview itself, as they can make translation challenging. While there are language-specific versions of these methods, they can lead to odd ungrammatical \"fragments\".

The MassAccess project uses the suffolklitlab-issues account to make issues, as seen in this example issue. token should be a GitHub personal access token associated with the user given in username. See the instruction for making a personal access token for more info. The feedback interview will save the feedback on the server with or without the above information, so you don't have to setup a GitHub account to get feedback from users. default repository owner should be your main GitHub organization or account that owns most of your interviews. For example, SuffolkLITLab, which owns MassAccess's repositories, and Illinois Legal Aid Online's GitHub account. allowed repository owners is optional, but necessary if your default repository owner doesn't own all of the repositories that you need to provide feedback for. If you want to be able to make issues on repositories from different organizations, you'll need to list each of them here. For example, Suffolk additionally hosts interviews made by MassLegalHelp. This is so users can't use your tool to spam issues on other organizations' GitHub repos. feedback session linking helps you as the server administrator debug tricky bugs. If this is set to True and if the user agrees, the feedback interview will save the session ID of their current interview on the server and link it to their feedback issue on github. This means that you can see the state of their interview when the user ran into their problem, making it easier to reproduce and fix their bug. You can browse the linked sessions in browse_feedback_sessions.yml. ask panel will add a question to the feedback interview, asking users if they want to be in a panel for user testing. If the user wants to be in a panel, it will ask for their email and save it in the server.

First, find an interview you'd like to add a feedback widget to. Where exactly you want to ask for feedback is up to you, but we'd recommend doing it where a user has reached an end point. For this how-to, we'll make a short example interview from scratch. The entire interview is below: include: - docassemble.GithubFeedbackForm:embedded_review.yml---mandatory: Truequestion: | First screensubquestion: | Welcome to this example interview. ${ only_once_review_widget() } The key lines in the above are: adding docassemble.GithubFeedbackForm:embedded_review.yml to the include block. You will have to do this even if you are using assembly_line.yml. ${ only_once_review_widget() } in the subquestion attribute of a question block The only_once_review_widget will ask two questions, one is a simple \"Did we help you?\" with thumbs up and thumbs down options, and the second is an open text box for users to write more. If they answer the first question and refresh the screen or continue through the interview, the feedback widget won't be shown again, given that the user doesn't go back past the widget's screen in the interview. You can change several aspects of the review widget. For more information, see the API reference of review_widget in ALToolbox. That is the function only_once_review_widget is using. The only_once_review_widget review information is only stored on the docassemble server, and can be viewed using the feedback browsing interview.","s":"How to get reviews in an interview","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/github_feedback","h":"#how-to-get-reviews-in-an-interview","p":698},{"i":712,"t":"You can view feedback for all interviews on a server if you are logged in as an admin.

These should be the same as the typical role. However, if typical role is unknown, then the user_ask_role variable will be here instead, and will ask the user what role they have in the case. Code for your custom questions comes next. All your questions should be triggered in here. You will probably make major edits to the code here, changing the order and adding branching logic. set_parts(subtitle=str(users)) adds to the information a logged in user will see for this interview in their list of interviews.

Errors combining two branches, trouble merging, trouble combining, resolve merge conflicts, fixing merge conflicts between two branches, branches diverged Sometimes when you start to make a pull request, GitHub will tell you that you have a merge conflict. This means that while you were making changes to your branch, changes were also made to the branch you are trying to merge with and they changed the same lines of code. Git will not decide which bits of code to keep where - you have to decide that. These are unavoidable and a pain to deal with. Everyone runs into them now and again and they are tricky to resolve without introducing bugs. tip Ways to reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts: If possible, make the goals of your branches small so that you only make a few changes on a branch before making a pull request with it. Merge pull requests in the order they were made. Avoid editing the same sections of code at the same time. If you are working with collaborators, try to make sure you are working on tasks that do not edit the same lines. You can still make your pull request, but GitHub will prohibit merging. There are two ways GitHub might handle merge conflicts: GitHub allows you to 'resolve' the conflict in GitHub itself by editing the files in GitHub. GitHub is unable to help you resolve the issue (it doesn't offer the option). Either way, the most reliable way to deal with this situation is, unfortunately, to redo your changes on top of the new code: Make the pull request as usual, and use it as a tool. The changes you made will be highlighted in the file comparison tab. In docassemble create a new Project and pull in the other branch (the one you want to merge with).

The basic rule is that Python variable names need to start with a letter and can only contain letters, digits, and the _ underscore character. Some variable names are reserved and have a special meaning inside AssemblyLine interviews. You should not use a variable name on the reserved list. Doing so can lead to hard to track bugs. Variable names are case sensitive - make them all lowercase​ Field names are case sensitive. The convention is to never re-use variable names with different capitalizations to store different things. Stick with all lower case names for fields when possible. Use the Python snake_case format for field labels​ In PDFs, labels should be all one word, lowercase, with multiple words separated by an underscore, the _ character. This convention is called snake_case. Do not use a . symbol or [] inside a PDF field's label. In a DOCX file, you can use the . symbol as well as brackets [] but they have a special meaning. The . separates an object from its attribute, and the [] indicates that you are referencing a list of items. Beginners should avoid these symbols except when instructed to do so for one of the variable names below. Use short but descriptive labels​ Use variable names that are descriptive but also short. Avoid using abbreviations. A good rule of thumb is to spell out acronyms and initialisms for clarity, but to freely remove words other than nouns and verbs to keep the names short. Use a name you would still understand if you read it in a year. About 30 characters is a good limit to the length of a variable name. It's unusual to need more than that. If your variable name is shorter than 5 characters, it might not be descriptive enough. Some suggestions for coming up with custom labels​ There are no hard and fast rules other than the ones listed above, but here are some conventions that may help you: Drop words from the variable name that don't add specific meaning. Filler words like \"a\", \"the\", etc. are almost never needed. Stick with nouns and verbs. Yes/no variables (also called boolean) commonly start with a form of the verb \"to be\" or \"to have\", paired with a noun. E.g., is_attorney or has_notice_to_quit. You can also use other verbs--writes_docassemble or saved_status or wants_copies_returned. Do not include the type of variable in the variable name itself. It is usually redundant and is not a common Python style. Exception: you might add something like _list or _date that is both a type and is descriptive of the variable's real world contents. There are now a number of samples of interviews built with the Assembly Line framework that you can find online. You can get ideas for variable names to use in your interview that match if they apply to the same concepts. When you're stuck, feel free to ask for help! It's a good idea to get a second opinion the first few times you label a document. A fellow programmer may have some good ideas to make your variable names shorter, clearer, or more closely follow programming conventions.","s":"General rules for labels","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables","h":"#general-rules-for-labels","p":932},{"i":942,"t":"We have identified common fields that exist in most paper court forms: names of people addresses information that identifies the court signatures dates currency figures a pair of yes/no checkboxes docket numbers or court filing numbers We came up with a convention to identify the roles that people may play in relation to your form: The \"user\" of the form: the person who the form is being filed for, making a request or response to the court The \"other_party\" of the form: the person who the user is responding to or suing We have also identified some common names for people that appear across many forms. By using the labels for fields that we selected, you will be able to use the questions that we have vetted and pre-written without needing to write them from scratch.

The Docassemble and DOCX variable name users[0] is the equivalent of users or users1 in a PDF label. users[1] is the equivalent of user2.

Typically there are three: The final version of a document with a signature. E.g., my_doc['final']. The preview version of a document with no signature. E.g., my_doc['preview']. An addendum of a document contained in the attribute addendum. E.g. my_doc.addendum. There is no limit to the number of keys, but the ALDocumentBundle class expects at least a \"final\" key to exist, and the addendum attribute is required if you desire to use PDF documents with text overflow. It is best practice to use exactly the two keys \"final\" and \"preview\" and the attribute \"addendum\". The \"final\" and \"preview\" documents will normally be the same template, but with logic controlling the display of a particular section, such as the signature. Each form that an interview generates should get its own ALDocument object. The \"addendum\" attribute can be handled in a generic object block. Multiple documents can use the same addendum template, with just the case caption varying. ALDocuments are designed to be used contingently as part of ALDocumentBundle objects. Each ALDocument is considered to be \"enabled\" or \"disabled\" for a particular interview user's session. This allows you to always work with a single object representing all of the possible documents an interview can generate, and use encapsulated logic to trigger individual documents inclusion on the final download screen. Attributes: filename str - name used for output PDF title str - display name for the output PDF enabled bool - if this document should be created. See examples. addendum DAFile | DAFileCollection - (optional) an attachment block overflow_fields ALAddendumField - (optional) ALAddendumFieldDict instance. These values will be used to detect and handle overflow. has_addendum bool - (optional) Defaults to False. Set to True if the document could have overflow, like for a PDF template. Notes: The enabled attribute should always be defined by a code block or the objects block, because by default it is considered fresh on each page load. If your interview logic requires that you directly ask the user whether or not to include a document, you can use a single intermediate variable that is posed to the interview user to work around this limitation.

Unfortunately, we still don’t have a good model for this and are looking for evidence-based research on it. Here are some unverified possibilities. For important choices, you can use a follow up screen to warn someone about their choice. If it’s not that important, you might consider skipping the validation completely. For radio buttons, you might only show the warning if they choose something you want to draw their attention to. A modal pop-up is one way to tell the user something might be wrong. Some people find those confusing and annoying. Another option is to show warning text under the field as soon as the user starts answering. You would hide it as soon as the answer looked good. You would allow the user to continue either way. With this method, some people may feel they’re being scolded before they’ve been given a chance to put in their answer. A possible way around the issue is to offer an “I know what I’m doing” checkbox that reveals a different field - one that won’t stop the user. Alternatively, you could have a review screen for the user before they submit their final answer and show the warning there.
