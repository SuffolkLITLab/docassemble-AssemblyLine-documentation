For slower projects, once every 2 weeks or once a month may be sufficient. Pick a day of the week and time in advance and set up a regular standing meeting on your calendar. Check-ins should generally be focused on quick status updates and resolving blockers and take from 15 minutes to 1 hour, depending on their frequency. Before each meeting, the team members should identify an agenda that focuses on: progress on meeting milestones and deadlines a list of blockers (things that prevent completing required tasks) questions that will benefit from input from the meeting participants Not everyone needs to attend each check-in meeting. It can be efficient on some projects to have everyone attend one meeting to get in sync, but it can also get expensive if the client is paying for your time. Weigh the benefits and costs carefully. It may depend on how effectively the asynchronous communication methods work for your project, which depends on individual team members. The project manager and the stakeholder or their representative are the most important participants on this meeting, to communicate progress on the work. Often, work can stall without these regularly scheduled check-ins. The project manager can separately schedule frequent standup meetings with the developers. A sample check-in schedule for a 4-9 month project Check-ins: Happen once a month The first check-in includes the whole team The rest include the project manager, the stakeholders, the lead developer, and any other developers only if they have questions that need live discussion A sample check-in schedule for a 3 month project Check-ins: Happen every 2 weeks Include the project manager, the stakeholders, and the lead developer","s":"Schedule a check-in cadence","u":"/docs/archive/working_with_teams","h":"#schedule-a-check-in-cadence","p":18},{"i":26,"t":"On the Assembly Line project, we default to using Kanban-style project boards to track interview progress.

Identify the following substantive points: The topic The purpose or purposes of the completed documents The party or user the form will be completed by or for For example: the plaintiff, defendant, testator Any limits to the jurisdiction Any other limits to the applicability (relative to the related problem a user might use the document for) For example: is this for minors or adults? Start to understand who the user is going to be​ Who is the most likely user of this tool? Possibilities often include: An attorney or paralegal who is experienced in this area of work A professional who may get light training (for example, a new employee or a volunteer in a clinic) A litigant on their own. What else do we know about the most likely user? Will they use this tool multiple times, or just once without training? Is the user encountering this tool because of a stressful, conflict-driven, or traumatic life experience? What education level will they have? What English language reading grade level will they have? Will they mostly using a desktop or a smartphone? Will they have access to a printer? Will they have reliable internet access? Will they be able to or need to return to complete the form in multiple sittings? Consider working with the client to create a few user personas. After you have built a few out, they should be validated with feedback from the client. ChatGPT can help you make user personas (but make sure you validate them). If the user is an attorney or paralegal in the firm, consider making a persona both for the attorney and for their ultimate client. A sample persona for an eviction defense tool Persona: Maria Rodriguez Age: 35 Location: Boston, Massachusetts Occupation: Retail Worker Family Status: Single mother with two children, ages 8 and 5 Income Level: Low-income bracket Housing Status: Renting a two-bedroom apartment in a building primarily occupied by similar low-income families Technology Use: Maria owns an older Android smartphone but has limited data. She's used to using social media and does all her communication on it Challenges Financial Strain: Maria’s earns $20,000 a year, which isn't enough for her expenses. She often has to decide between paying different bills. Lack of Legal Knowledge: She has limited understanding of her rights as a tenant and feels intimidated by legal processes. Access to Resources: Maria has limited access to technology and legal assistance due to her financial situation and work hours. Goals Stability: Maria’s primary goal is to provide a stable home for her children. She wants to avoid eviction to maintain access to her children’s school and her local support network. Education: She is keen to learn more about her rights as a tenant and how she can legally contest an unfair eviction. Assistance: Maria needs easy-to-understand, accessible legal advice and support that fits into her limited budget and time constraints. How sophisticated does the automation need to be?​ Look over the Legal app maturity model. What level form will be your target for this project? Keep in mind both the sophistication of your user, available time and budget constraints, and any safety concerns. For a tool aimed at legal professionals, a level 1.5 or level 2 form is usually enough. For a tool aimed at the general public, a level 2 is usually the minimum. Targeting level 3 or 4 is always tempting, but depending on constraints may not be justified by the increased time and cost. You should release a first draft at the earliest safe stage, and then continue refining only as long as appropriate based on the needs of the end user for this particular project.","s":"Understanding the project's users and intended purpose","u":"/docs/archive/working_with_teams","h":"#understanding-the-projects-users-and-intended-purpose","p":18},{"i":31,"t":"Come up with a rough schedule with key milestones. When coming up with a project timeline, think about both resources and the project's size. Resource constraints include: Available working hours (a typical developer has 25 productive hours in a week, while a student can allocate about 1/2 of their credit hour expectations to development and may also take 3-5 times as long as an experienced developer at the same tasks) Other ongoing projects Delivering early and frequent work to the client for review and feedback Complexity is affected by: The number of formatted pages (static pages without fields or logic don't add to complexity) Expected precision and fidelity Complexity of formatting for lists, headings, names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. Whether language must be made dynamic to account for quantity, pronouns, and relationships How flexible pagination will be in the output document depending on the amount of optional text or the quantities of people (such as children, agents, etc.) Number of fields The complexity of the fields and responses possible for each field The number of branching logic points (often caused by conditional language or documents in the output) The kind of output documents that are expected: Multiple sets, in different combinations, for different quantities of people? With addenda or other ancillary documents that need to be created from scratch? For a project involving one form, the first milestone should be a working draft of the tool that completes every question, even if it is in a very rough order. Set a deadline for this. With the help of the Weaver, it should be possible to reach this in 10-15 hours for even a quite long form. Be willing to postpone certain features to hit this first milestone. You'll need to communicate very clearly with the client that this rough prototype is not even close to the final product but that you still need their high level feedback on it. For a project involving multiple forms, we recommend: Starting with the simplest form to get the client's early feedback Moving on to the most complex form to confirm the shape and logic of the whole process with your client Then continuing with the remaining forms Sample timeline for a project with 12 forms of varied complexity Each phase is scheduled for 2 weeks-2 months: Phase 1, 2 weeks: Completion of a draft of 1 key document, which may include a subset of the full functionality, in order to obtain the client's input and review. The decisions that come out of this first document will guide completion of the remaining 11 documents. Phase 2: Completion of drafts of up to 6 of the remaining documents. Coordination of usability tests to identify changes that should apply to the remaining documents. Phase 3: Completion of the full document set. Some functionality may be in a rough draft or ommitted for this stage. Phase 4: All functionality is implemented. client to review and offer suggestions. Coordinate for second round of usability testing and feedback. Final phase: based on the final feedback and proposed changes, complete all remaining work. Budget up to 30 hours for this phase.","s":"Identify a project timeline","u":"/docs/archive/working_with_teams","h":"#identify-a-project-timeline","p":18},{"i":33,"t":"Consider success in terms of: Time Total people helped People who can now complete the process who couldn't before For a commercial project, this directly corresponds to money: either a reduced fee you can charge a client, or an increased profit, or both. How will we know if the project is successful? Time How much time does the process take now? What time savings (per use) is enough to justify the project? People helped How many people need the solution your tool helps with? For example: About 10,000 people are brought to eviction court in Massachusetts each year. How many people would be enough to reach? 10%? 30%? More? For example: helping 2,000 of the 10,000 people who are evicted represents a significant percentage of the whole even though it is a relatively small absolute number. Closing an access gap Who is not appropriate to complete the process now due to lack of training or legal specific expertise, but can be after your tool exists? For example: will your tool allow a social worker to complete the process, whereas before it required a lawyer or paralegal? Who can't easily participate in the process now, due to language, reading grade level, complexity, or other barriers? How will your tool reduce or eliminate these barriers? Think in advance how you will measure success on these criteria. You can use the Interview Stats package to track usage. Usability tests, reading grade level measurements, and auditing for best practices may all help you understand how you closed the access gap with your tool. Consider a pre-mortem​ A pre-mortem can be helpful on larger and riskier projects. Pre-mortems are a technique that asks participants to imagine a project's failure in advance, without judgment or blame. Studies show that premortems can increase the success of projects because they make it easier for stakeholders to \"correctly identify the reasons for future outcomes\" by as much as 30%. Once you have identified the future causes of failure, act to reduce the risks, or consider whether the project is still worth trying.","s":"Understanding success metrics","u":"/docs/archive/working_with_teams","h":"#understanding-success-metrics","p":18},{"i":35,"t":"A legal app is always an intervention at a particular point in a larger and more complex process. Your app will need to take into account the before and after steps as well as the steps that you automate. Don't expect to have complete answers to these questions in your first client interview. But you'll need to know all of the answers at different stages in your project. Document the user's ultimate goal and any intermediate goals​ For example: you may automate an estate plan. The user's goal is to identify a guardian for their children and to pass on their assets to specific people. Getting a will or trust is an intermediate goal, not the ultimate success state. Keep the final goal in mind. Identify sources of information​ What primary law sources and secondary sources are important for this project? Who knows about the current process? Identify experts both within and outside the participating organizations Document the before, during, and after​ What steps in the real world must take place before someone can use your tool? For example: before filing an answer in a court case, the defendant has to have been served a complaint. What information will the user need to have ready before they use the tool? For example: they may need to look at the complaint, do a diligent search for military status, or more. You can't wait until the middle of your app to tell them this! What information will the user need to provide when they use the tool? Roughly classify the kind and number of answers needed using the Jarrett and Gaffney framework, namely: Slot-in, or information the user already knows, like their own name and address Gathered, information the user will look up from a readily available source like a court notice or a government ID Third-party, information the user will get by calling someone or looking it up in a database Created, answers the user will make on the spot What decision points will be made during usage of the tool? What branching logic and follow up questions will be needed? How will this change the output document? What sources are available to consult when they use the tool, manually or automatically? For example: Online court docket Case management systems or CRMs Help pages, glossaries, documentation, and videos? What are the outputs of the tool? What templates will be automated? How will the templates be grouped or bundled for different recipients? Are any documents produced in a mirrored form (for example, for each spouse) or copied for multiple named parties (for example, one per child?) Will any ancillary documents need to be created that aren't already in existence, like: Addenda for overflow text Affidavits Motions What happens after the user completes the automated steps? How will the document be signed or notarized? How will it be served on the other party, if applicable? How will copies be provided to other parties, such as designated agents, hospitals, or others? How will it be filed in court, if applicable? What does the user need to know about the possible outcomes and decisions that will be made based on their document? Should any parts of the process be left un-automated? What compliance or regulation needs to be kept in mind? One approach to this is to interview someone who currently completes the process. Have them pretend that you are the client and ask questions as they walk you through filling in the form or gathering the information needed to complete the document. Interview key stakeholders to get answers. Write down the responses and make your own observations.

It takes the name of the Docassemble variable in quotes as its only parameter.

You may have made a typo or mistake with your variable names, and ended up asking something that is also defined by an Assembly Line question. This could lead to 2 or more very similar questions. You might not have defined something, like the party roles, that your interview now needs to know in order to make sense.","s":"Why is this question getting asked?!!!","u":"/docs/authoring/customizing_interview","h":"#why-is-this-question-getting-asked","p":59},{"i":92,"t":"Assembly Line interviews almost always have some questions that come from the \"question library.\" The question library is just a YAML file named ql_baseline.yml. It contains questions about people's names, addresses, birthdates, gender and pronouns, and party roles. You can always write your own version of a question in the library. Docassemble reads your YAML file from top to bottom, so if you add your question that defines the same variables after the include block, Docassemble will always use your version. You maybe shouldn't write your own version. The question library questions are tested by real users. Some customization is to be expected, but be sure you have a clear reason for your choice. Question library questions don't appear in your own YAML file. But you can copy them when your interview is running. Here's how: In the top navigation bar, click the \"source\" button (it looks like </>). Scroll down until you see the question text. Copy it into your own YAML file. Near the other question blocks in your interview is the best place. Add the --- separator at the beginning of the block you copy. Make the changes that you want. About generic object The generic object modifier is a special way to make one question work for many different objects, like people or lists of people. When you customize a question from the question library, you may want to make it specific to one variable in your interview, rather than replace the generic version of the question for any person. To make it specific: Remove the generic object line. Replace x with your variable name. Customize the question and subquestion as needed. For example, suppose your interview asks for a list of guardians. There is no special question about guardians in the question library, so your interview will use the generic object version of the question, which looks like this: --- id: name of the first person sets: - x[0].name.first - x[0].name.last - x[0].name.middle - x[0].name.suffix generic object: ALPeopleList question: | % if hasattr(x, 'ask_number') and x.ask_number and x.target_number == 1: Name of ${ noun_plural(x.object_name(),1) } % else: Name of your first ${ noun_plural(x.object_name(),1) } % endif fields: - code: | x[0].name_fields() Here is a version made specific to guardians: --- id: name of the first person sets: - guardians[0].name.first - guardians[0].name.last - guardians[0].name.middle - guardians[0].name.suffix question: | What is the name of the first person you want to name as guardian? fields: - code: | guardians[0].name_fields() A specific version of a question is always used before the generic object version. About the variable i Just like generic object works for any object, the variable i (and other index variables) lets you write a question for any item in a list. Using a specific number (typically, just the first, or 0th item is treated specially) overrides the one that uses the letter i.","s":"Understanding the question library","u":"/docs/authoring/customizing_interview","h":"#understanding-the-question-library","p":59},{"i":94,"t":"Every screen in Docassemble is asked for a reason, and you can always find out why.

Fix this by customizing the form type. Similarly, you were asked early in the Weaver if there could be one, any number, or at least one for every list of people in your interview.

These are covered in more depth in the documentation for DAList, although it may be hard to find the specific functions on that fairly long documentation page without internal anchors. The best solution to learn more may be to read about the method on this page, then visit the DAList documentation page and search within the page for the appropriate keyword with command/control+f. Be careful with grammar shortcuts if the interview will be translated These functions help you write short, readable code, but they result in text \"fragments\". In languages that have a different order of verbs, subjects, and objects, this can result in nonsense.

Use branches to isolate the feature, bug, or other issue you are working on. Commit to the branch as you edit, and then when you are finished making your changes, create a pull request to merge the branch into main. Don't use sub-branches It's best to avoid creating branches from branches other than main. Sub-branches tend to make merge conflicts more likely. Naming branches​ Name the branch for the issue you are working on. Branch names should be descriptive, unique, and in snake case. One easy way to make the branch name unique is to include the issue or partial date. For example: 78_update_review_screen (Issue #78 calls for updating the review screen.) 2024_01_update_court_form (Including the year and month makes the branch name more specific.)

You may not actually have made any changes to the files even though you thought you did. If you see 403​ A 403 error means you do not have write permission for the repository. Ask the person or organization that owns it to give you permission or add you to a team that has permission. If you are trying to make a new repository on your GitHub account, you may belong to an organization that already has a repository with the same name.

But if you cannot find a matching label, use the general rules below to add as many custom labels as you need. Labels should be valid Python variable names that start with a letter​ PDF and DOCX labels should also work as valid Python variable names. The basic rule is that Python variable names need to start with a letter and can only contain letters, digits, and the _ underscore character. Some variable names are reserved and have a special meaning inside AssemblyLine interviews. You should not use a variable name on the reserved list. Doing so can lead to hard to track bugs. Variable names are case sensitive - make them all lowercase​ Field names are case sensitive. The convention is to never re-use variable names with different capitalizations to store different things. Stick with all lower case names for fields when possible. Use the Python snake_case format for field labels​ In PDFs, labels should be all one word, lowercase, with multiple words separated by an underscore, the _ character. This convention is called snake_case. Do not use a . symbol or [] inside a PDF field's label. In a DOCX file, you can use the . symbol as well as brackets [] but they have a special meaning. The . separates an object from its attribute, and the [] indicates that you are referencing a list of items. Beginners should avoid these symbols except when instructed to do so for one of the variable names below. Use short but descriptive labels​ Use variable names that are descriptive but also short. Avoid using abbreviations. A good rule of thumb is to spell out acronyms and initialisms for clarity, but to freely remove words other than nouns and verbs to keep the names short. Use a name you would still understand if you read it in a year. About 30 characters is a good limit to the length of a variable name. It's unusual to need more than that. If your variable name is shorter than 5 characters, it might not be descriptive enough. Some suggestions for coming up with custom labels​ There are no hard and fast rules other than the ones listed above, but here are some conventions that may help you: Drop words from the variable name that don't add specific meaning. Filler words like \"a\", \"the\", etc. are almost never needed. Stick with nouns and verbs. Yes/no variables (also called boolean) commonly start with a form of the verb \"to be\" or \"to have\", paired with a noun. E.g., is_attorney or has_notice_to_quit. You can also use other verbs--writes_docassemble or saved_status or wants_copies_returned. Do not include the type of variable in the variable name itself. It is usually redundant and is not a common Python style. Exception: you might add something like _list or _date that is both a type and is descriptive of the variable's real world contents. There are now a number of samples of interviews built with the Assembly Line framework that you can find online. You can get ideas for variable names to use in your interview that match if they apply to the same concepts. When you're stuck, feel free to ask for help! It's a good idea to get a second opinion the first few times you label a document. A fellow programmer may have some good ideas to make your variable names shorter, clearer, or more closely follow programming conventions.","s":"General rules for labels","u":"/docs/authoring/label_variables","h":"#general-rules-for-labels","p":306},{"i":316,"t":"We have identified common fields that exist in most paper court forms: names of people addresses information that identifies the court signatures dates currency figures a pair of yes/no checkboxes docket numbers or court filing numbers We came up with a convention to identify the roles that people may play in relation to your form: The \"user\" of the form: the person who the form is being filed for, making a request or response to the court The \"other_party\" of the form: the person who the user is responding to or suing We have also identified some common names for people that appear across many forms.

For each of the other variables in the review block, clicking their \"Edit\" button brings users directly to the question to let them edit their answers. That approach works well for simple variables like text, dates that the user enters, or yes no questions. But your interview might include objects and lists of objects, like a list of plaintiffs and another list of defendants. Instead of re-asking every question that someone answered to fill the list, docassemble brings to the user to a revisit screen that shows each item in the list to the user, and lets them choose which to edit individually. If you used the Weaver to make your interview, your interview might have a few different lists for people, like users, other_parties, children, debt_collectors, and guardians. The revisit screens each show the table attribute of the DAList. If needed, blocks defining the table for the lists will appear at the end of the generated review file. table: children.table rows: children columns: - Birthdate: | row_item.birthdate if hasattr(row_item, 'birthdate') else '' edit: - birthdate Edits to the Review Screen​ You'll want to change some aspects of the generated review screen. Note that if any errors happen in a specific edit element on the review screen, that element won't appear. It also won't appear if the attribute or variable to be edited doesn't exist. You should make sure that it does. Some common issues to the generated review screen that I personally have run into before: Remove generated revisit and table blocks for attachments and other non-people objects, if any, as well as their entries in the review block. revisit is only needed for things the user enters themselves. Since the review screen generator can't determine which object types people have to enter information for, it generates them for all objects. Remove questions you don't want the user to edit. Sometimes, you will have questions that do set a variable in the interview, but the variable isn't used in the interview logic after that. For example, a question that's only use is to kickout a user if their problem isn't covered by the form. Here's an example of one: --- question: | Are you Filing in a Probate Case? fields: - Is your case a probate case?: probate_case datatype: yesnoradio --- event: probate_case_exit question: | You cannot continue to use the tool. subquestion: | Based on your answer, you can't use this tool. Probate cases have different procedural rules than other cases. You may want to speak to a lawyer. If you made a mistake, click the **Undo** button. Otherwise, click the **Exit** button to return to Michigan Legal Help. buttons: - Exit: exit url: https://michiganlegalhelp.org If editing the value of a variable like this would only lead the person to a kickout screen and not change any other logic of the interview, then the generated review section should be removed.","s":"Step 2: Understanding and Editing the Generated Review Screen","u":"/docs/authoring/review_screen","h":"#step-2-understanding-and-editing-the-generated-review-screen","p":375},{"i":389,"t":"You'll find that certain variables often depend on each other, either explicitly or implicitly. For example, if you have a variable called hearing_date_and_time that you set to hearing_date + \" \" + hearing_time, you should recompute that field whenever the user edits the hearing date or time. You can do something like this to update the variable whenever you edit the hearing date: - label: Edit fields: - hearing_date - recompute: - hearing_date_and_time button: | ... Another example of when two variables are implicitly dependent would be if you asked the user if the plaintiff or defendant is paying child support. If the user changes what side of the case they are on, their answer to what side is paying might change too! You can use a review entry that looks like this to edit both. - label: Edit fields: - user_ask_role - who_paid As mentioned in step 2, if a variable doesn't exist or any errors occur when showing a section of the review screen, that whole section won't be shown. If some of the fields on a screen or optional, then their absence can cause their section of the review screen to not appear. Use showifdef on optional fields, or fields that use show if, to prevent this issue. While writing the review screen, you will likely have to redo your interview logic, so that it doesn't make assumptions about the presence or absence of variables, just their values, which I'd encourage. From the docassemble documentation: For example, if you ask “Do you want to include your cell phone number?” and then you ask “What is your cell phone number,” the user’s cell phone number will be defined. If the user then changes the answer to the “Do you want to include your cell phone number?” question, then you will have a situation where the user’s cell phone number is defined but it should not be used.

If one interview assembles multiple complex forms. In that case, it may be helpful to put any unique questions for each form, as well as the attachment block, into its own YAML file. If the YAML file simply is getting too large to easily manage. In that case, you might break up the YAML into multiple files that are easier to edit. In this case, make sure the reasoning for each file is clear. E.g., you could separate the interview's metadata, questions, and logic into three separate files. Even if an interview makes sense on its own, you may want to make it re-usable as a module in other interviews. For example: a fee waiver, an interpreter notice, or a request for accommodation. In that case, you want to make sure that the mandatory logic and metadata are separated from the part you want to re-use in other interviews. Keep things simple when you can! Think ahead to the developer experience. If you are dividing work across multiple authors, think through what a single change will look like. Can an author make a change without having to edit multiple YAML files in most cases? Our current recommendations to name the files in this scenario are: Any runnable files in your package should be named main.yml. If there are multiple runnable files, give each file the prefix main_. (main has a long history in computer programming.) If the interview assembles multiple documents, you can make a separate YAML file for each document that contains the unique questions it needs and the document's attachment block. Name it after the document itself, e.g., financial_statement.yml. (be consistent with this: if the separate documents are very short, you may not need this, but it should be all or nothing inside a single package.) Name the file that is used by multiple related interview endpoints shared.yml. info Remember, there should be only one mandatory block in a given combination of YAML files. That means you should never put a mandatory block in the files for each individual document. To group logic that you might want to run with the template it relates to, without making it mandatory: use the named block pattern for the interview order block reference your named block in a mandatory block inside the main file that users will run. While in the development phase, you might want to temporarily test a single document at a time. You can do so by making, e.g., a financial_statement.yml and a main_financial_statement.yml file. The mandatory block will be in the main_financial_statement.yml and reference the named block inside the financial_statement.yml file. Be careful to not rely on this for more than quick tests! You'll always want a final round of testing when financial_statement.yml runs in combination with the forms you want the user to interact with. If you need to subdivide very long YAML files further: Label files that contain only questions questions.yml, or prefix with questions_. If the name is too long, ql_eviction.yml is a reasonable abbreviation that follows the Assembly Line's existing conventions. Name shared files that contain other kind of functionality, e.g., integration with a separate service, support.yml or prefix the filename with support_. E.g., support_legal_server.yml, support_s3.yml. Name files that contain only logic logic.yml, or prefix with logic_. E.g., logic_eviction_defenses.yml. Name files that contain functionality that only affects the appearance of the interview (e.g., loading CSS, various default screen parts) theme.yml or visual.yml. Name files that contain the review screen logic review.yml or prefix with review_. Examples: An interview with exactly one YAML file in it​ Filename Purpose eviction.yml or main_eviction.yml The one YAML file containing mandatory blocks, attachments, metadata. The whole enchilada. info In our experience, some special setup/integration code, like e-filing, should normally go in its own file. We have found that developers of the guided interview do not want to be overwhelmed with the logic needed to support e-filing. If you are using e-filing, add a file named support_efiling.yml with any e-filing setup code inside of it. A fee waiver that can be assembled by many different interviews​ Filename Purpose main.yml or main_fee_waiver.yml The runnable interview file when someone wants ONLY the fee waiver. Contains mandatory code and metadata (e.g., interview title), and the document bundle (al_user_bundle and al_court_bundle). fee_waiver.yml Has no mandatory logic. Contains questions and the attachment block, and a \"named block\" with interview order logic that can be referenced in a parent interview's mandatory interview order block. An interview that assembles multiple documents in different combinations depending on audience​ Filename Purpose main_petition_for_guardianship.yml Entry point for an interested person. Has metadata, a mandatory interview order block and the document bundle (al_user_bundle and al_court_bundle). main_object_to_guardianship.yml Entry point for the person whose right is being restricted (e.g., a parent or incapacitated adult). Has metadata, a mandatory interview order block and the document bundle (al_user_bundle and al_court_bundle). shared.yml Contains shared questions, and only questions (perhaps with some basic code setting simple shared variables), for the guardianship process that multiple documents might need written the same way. petition_for_guardianship.yml Contains unique questions for the petition and attachment code. No mandatory blocks. bond.yml Contains unique questions, logic, and attachment code for a bond form. request_for_counsel.yml Contains unique questions, logic, and attachment code for a counsel request form. No mandatory blocks. A complex interview with only one entry point but where managing a single YAML file is too cumbersome​ Filename Purpose main.yml or eviction.yml Metadata, mandatory logic, document bundle questions.yml Only questions logic.yml Code blocks that define various behavior, such as whether a defense or claim will be made. support_efiling.yml Independent support / setup code to enable connection to the Suffolk E-filing proxy server. support_legal_server.yml Support / setup code that handles connecting to the Legal Server CMS. support_office_365.yml Support / setup code for connecting to Office 365. theme.yml or visual.yml Code / setup / metadata that controls the appearance of the interview, but nothing else. review.yml The review screen, and any revisit blocks and tables needed purely for the review screen to work. info Above we suggest that you can use either main.yml (a functional name) or eviction.yml (descriptive). Remember that the descriptive name is great when you are sure that you will only have one \"descriptive\" name in the package.

It returns True or False depending on whether the user specifies that the_individual.gender == 'female'. There is also a matching gender_male and gender_other method.

They include: the question help button the glossary terms feature the under area the field hint modifier that adds placeholder text the field help modifier the option help modifier Through expert feedback, we have determined that the question help button should never be used. The placement of the button and the use of a separate mode for help text can be confusing. Help may also come \"too late\" with this feature, after a user has already completed answering the questions on screen. We also discourage use of the hint modifier that adds placeholder text to a field. Multiple references discourage this feature. The under feature can be a helpful place to add additional context to a screen, although the field-specific note feature may be more consistent with user expectations across multiple questions. The glossary terms feature should be used cautiously, perhaps with additional CSS to make it more distinctive. The risk with this feature is distracting or confusing users. The field and option help modifiers are both relatively clear and simple to use for field-specific hints and to explain choices that may otherwise not be clear.

When you run its interview, you will be able to pick a Project from your Playground and run the tests in that Project. Pros (Moving) You don't need to put your package on GitHub to run the tests. Running ALKiln on your server lets you loop through your development cycle faster - edit, test, edit, test. You don't have to go through committing your code to GitHub every time. You can see the output online right away, including images and documents. In GitHub, to see all of the output files, you have to download a zip file. The only thing you can see online in GitHub is the summary report. You can more easily limit your tests to a specific set of tests using tag expressions. You can use tags on GitHub too, it just takes more steps. You can more often avoid the red \"x\" that appears next to failing tests on GitHub. The red \"x\" is a useful piece of information, but it can be uncomfortable. Cons (Moving) You'll miss catching some kinds of mistakes. Specifically, you may add a file to your Playground and forget to commit it to GitHub. Your tests will pass in your Playground, but your interview will break when you or others install it from GitHub. If your server reloads while the tests are running, ALKiln may come to a complete stop and you'll have to start the tests all over again. What ALKiln is doing (Moving) When you run Playground tests, they do the following: ALKiln navigates to the file your tests specifies in the Project you picked. For each test (or Scenario), ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to whatever interview you named in the test in the Project you chose. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test. If one of the Steps fails, ALKiln adds that to the test report and tries to take a picture of the page with the problem. It tries to avoid taking pictures of sensitive information. When the tests are done, the output page will show you all the generated reports, images, and files if it can. It will also give you a link to download some of that in a .zip file.","s":"Testing your Playground Projects","u":"/docs/components/ALKiln/advanced","h":"#testing-your-playground-projects","p":496},{"i":503,"t":"(Moving) These tests run on GitHub, but they still interact with your server and basically do the same things the Playground tests do, you're just not there to see. Pros (Moving) ALKiln on GitHub will test any changes any team member commits. On your server, you only tests your changes. On GitHub, there are ways to schedule tests to run regularly - every week, every day, or whatever schedule you prefer. If packages you depend on change and break your code, those tests will let you know. If you've forgotten to add a file to the package that an interview depends on (like a missing template file), GitHub will catch that. It installs the file fresh in a new Project, so it only has the files that have been committed properly. You can continue editing any files in your Playground while the GitHub tests run because GitHub creates a whole new Project of its own. When running tests on your server, you must avoid editing the Project that ALKiln is testing. You can configure your GitHub \"action\" to do other things, like create GitHub issues whenever tests fail. If your server reloads during the test run, a few individual tests may fail, but ALKiln will still be able to continue and keep trying to run the rest of the tests. That is because the test code is in running from GitHub, so your reload doesn't stop that process. Cons (Moving) To get these set up, you need to create a docassemble API key, a GitHub token, and make GitHub secrets and you may have to update these in the future. The ALKiln test setup interview helps you do these things, but they can still be confusing. Your tests might be more flaky. That means they may fail for reasons that don't have to do with the interviews. For example, if your tests are running while your server is reloading, ALKiln will keep running, so other tests will still have an opportunity to continue, but individual tests may fail even if your code is correct. Your server can reload for many reasons - updating your config, installing a new package, etc. When tests fail meaninglessly, it slows down your development cycle and sometimes people end up turning off the tests instead of dealing with the complexity. What ALKiln is doing (Moving) Whenever you push (or commit) to GitHub, GitHub will run the tests automatically. You can also trigger them manually. ALKiln goes to the testing account you set up on your server and creates a new Project. If you log into that account, you'll be able to see the new Project in the list of projects. It pulls the relevant branch of your package into the Project. For each test (or Scenario), ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to whatever interview you named in the test. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test. If one of the Steps fails, ALKiln adds that to the test report and tries to take a picture of the page with the problem. It tries to avoid taking pictures of sensitive information. When all the tests are done, ALKiln deletes the Project it created. (Moving) You can see the tests running on your repository's GitHub Actions page. (Moving) At the end, you can see a report and logs right in the workflow's \"job\" page or download a .zip file containing the results of the tests to your computer. That .zip file is what GitHub calls an \"artifact\".","s":"Triggering tests on your server from GitHub","u":"/docs/components/ALKiln/advanced","h":"#triggering-tests-on-your-server-from-github","p":496},{"i":505,"t":"(Moving) These tests also run on GitHub, but they create a new docassemble server on GitHub itself and interact with that. They never touch your server. Pros (Moving) This is the most secure of all the methods. The tests don't interact with your server at all. Since the other tests should be running on a test server, not a production server, this shouldn't be a big advantage, but still - the tests have less chance of accidentally exposing the information of other users on that server. All the advantages listed above for the other type of GitHub tests except this improvement: Your tests will generally be less flaky. When a test fails it's more likely to be a problem with your code instead of a problem with the server. That's because the server is isolated on GitHub and no one is going to make that isolated server reload in the middle of the tests. You don't have to set up or update any docassemble API keys or GitHub tokens. Cons (Moving) Tests take about 5 minutes longer since they have to do things like create a docker container and start a server. The GitHub server installs the latest version of docassemble, which might be a different version than the one you use on your server. Allowing authors to install specific versions would take longer to run. We're still considering if this is a feature we should create. We would appreciate feedback. Regardless of that, whatever server GitHub generates probably won't have the exact same setup as your server, so some interviews may not have the same behavior. You have to be more diligent about including all the \"Dependencies\" that your package needs on your interview's \"Packages\" page. If you don't, they won't be installed with your package on this fresh server. What ALKiln is doing ([writing_tests(setup.mdx#sandbox-stages)) Like the other GitHub test method, whenever you push (or commit) to GitHub, GitHub will run the tests automatically. You can run these manually as well. ALKiln creates a fresh docker container and docassemble server in GitHub itself. If you have given ALKiln a docassemble config, it uses that config. It tries to get the log for that process and saves it as an artifact on your GitHub action's summary page. It installs the interview as a package directly on the server. ALKiln does the same things we described above, creating the same GitHub artifacts. When all the tests are done, GitHub destroys the server that ALKiln created. tip (Deleted because users never get to it) If you do run both the GitHub-triggered tests and the GitHub isolated server tests, you'll get the fastest results possible. That is, if all goes well, the GitHub-triggered tests might end first and pass. If they don't and the problem is just with your server, the GitHub isolated server tests might complete sooner. If your server is fine, the GitHub-triggered tests will again finish faster. You'll get the fastest results possible.

On GitHub, there are ways to schedule tests to run regularly - every week, every day, or on your birthday. While your code is sitting around happily staying the same, a package you use, or even docassemble itself, might update its code and break the interview. Scheduled tests will let you know. Unlike ALKilnInThePlayground™ tests, you can keep editing your Project's code without a care in the world. Except python files. They cause the server to reload.

For some people: If your interview uses docassemble background actions then your server must let at least 3 celery processes run at the same time. You can manually set the number of celery processes in your server's config file. If you are using a docassemble Docker image created before April 9th, 2023, you will have to do a \"system upgrade\" to update your server to a newer docassemble Docker image. Any version of https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble-os that is older than 1.0.8 uses versions of node that are too old for ALKiln. As of February 11th, 2024, ALKiln is using node version 18. A lot of people have upgraded already and it is a very good idea to do that, for security at the very least.

You can edit whatever files you want on your own server because GitHub Sandbox™ tests don't touch your server at all. In some cases, no GitHub secrets are necessary. Your tests will generally be less flaky. When a test fails it is more likely to be a problem with your code instead of a problem with the server, giving you better information. That's because the server is isolated, or \"sandboxed\"1, on GitHub and no one is going to make that sandboxed server reload in the middle of the tests. You do not have to set up or update any docassemble API keys or GitHub tokens. It might be useful to test custom data types on a sandboxed server. A docassemble CustomDatatype affects a whole server.

The GitHub server installs the latest version of docassemble, which might be a different version than the one you use on your production server. Any server other than your production server will be different in some ways, though. Since you should never run these tests on your production server, there is no way to avoid that. In most cases, you should avoid writing tests that use hard-coded urls that go to your server. That is, avoid using links in your tests that start with your server's address. For example, https://my-server.com. Avoid linking to interviews or other pages there. That will send the tests to your server, which makes them less secure again. For some people: Right now, GitHub Sandbox™ tests are unable to handle data stored externally. For example, data stored in an S3 bucket.4 If you are including any other packages in your interview, you must make sure you have properly required them in the \"Dependencies\" section of your Playground Packages page. This is an example of code that uses the Assembly Line package: include: - docassemble.AssemblyLine:al_package.yml Because of that code, the author needs to require the AssemblyLine package as a dependency. This is what it looks like to require the Assembly Line package: Save your choices and commit them to GitHub. All the packages your package uses, like Assembly Line, must be published on pypi. That is the only place that the sandboxed server can get them. Those packages must also correctly require all their dependencies and those must be published on pypi as well. If your package is too big, you will be unable to use this type of test. GitHub Sandbox™ tests install your package on the server itself. That makes sure your package's dependencies get automatically installed too. The method ALKiln needs to use to install your package on the server will reject big packages. We are unsure about the exact limits, but we know it must be less than 30 MB. If you use any API keys for third-party services, like Google geolocation or recaptcha3, you must write code that has alternatives to using those services. This is fairly complicated.

Limiting ALKiln's access means that it: Never has access to actual user information Never has access to your production server's security-critical data like configuration tokens Never has access to your current or old production databases Can never affect the files on your production server First and foremost, avoid installing or running GitHub+You™ and ALKilnInThePlayground™ tests on your production server1. Have a separate server for those testing methods. GitHub Sandbox™ tests already make their own server and can be the most secure if you use them properly. Use those if you are able to use them.

For example: Never share data between your production server and your testing server. For example, if your production server uses a Google spreadsheet to store some user or server data, create a separate Google spreadsheet with fake data for your testing server. Never use old databases. Some projects realize that they should avoid using their current user database for testing. Instead, they decide to use an old database. Avoid that as well.

That is called \"freezing\" the version. Then, when you are ready, you can look at what has changed and decide which version you want to update to. By default, ALKiln runs your tests with its latest version. This means you have all the latest bug fixes and new features. Some organizations choose to use a version that has code and behavior that is familiar and comfortable for them. ALKiln is actually made of 2 parts. One part is the ALKiln framework, which lets you control the robot that goes to your interview and fills in answers. Another part of ALKiln is its GitHub actions, which manage setting up, starting, and cleaning up the tests. Because of factors out of our control, each of these parts has a different way to set the version. To freeze the framework, you need to use the semantic version number. For example, \"5.8.0\". To freeze the actions, you need to use the 40-character git commit id. Both of those need to point to the same5 code. For example, the semantic version \"5.8.0\" of the ALKiln framework should be paired with the git commit with the id e79eb61cb97603d41375134d505e4fe60de7780d that controls the actions. To freeze your version: Find the semantic version that you want. Look at the \"git blame\" for our package.json. Find the 3rd line. It should be the line that shows ALKiln's version. To see the previous version, you can tap on this symbol: Go back in history by tapping on that symbol until you find the version you are looking for. For example, 5.8.0. Find the matching commit id. Tap on the commit message for that line. In the address bar of your web browser, look for a 40-character long set of random letters and numbers. The whole address might look something like this: https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln/commit/e79eb61cb97603d41375134d505e4fe60de7780d. In that example url, the commit id (or SHA4) is e79eb61cb97603d41375134d505e4fe60de7780d. Set both versions. Find your workflow file. Tap to edit the file. Go to the lines that look similar to the ones below. uses: SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln@v5 with: SERVER_URL: \"${{ secrets.SERVER_URL }}\" DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY: \"${{ secrets.DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY }}\" Replace v5 with the commit id you found. For example, a29519914ffc235802be9b9b143d78ffc3a06028. Add a line below DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY. The indentation level should be the same as DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY. Add the text ALKILN_VERSION: \"\" Between the quotes, put the semantic version that matches the commit id. For example, 5.8.0. Save the file.

By default, GitHub prevents first-time contributors from triggering pull request workflows without your permission. Unfortunately, some people make first-time contributions that are very reasonable, like fixing typos. Once you accept that contribution, they are then able to trigger workflows with their pull requests. Before making that pull request, they can edit the code of the tests, the workflow, or the rest of the interview to contain malicious code. You can make those settings more strict for public repositories and for organizations. One setting makes sure no outside collaborator can trigger workflows with a pull request without your approval.

How it works: You tell the Story Table Step what question you want to get to. You also make a table of the variables and values the test will need to fill in on its way to that page. Whenever the test gets to a page, it checks your Story Table for any variable names in the table that match a variable name on the page. When the test finds a match, it sets the field to the corresponding value. When the test is done filling in fields on a page, it continues to the next page and repeats until it reaches that question id you gave. As you can see in the example, the order of the items doesn't matter. The test will fill in the fields no matter what order they come in. You will be able to make simple edits to the interview without needing to update your tests. For example, you can move pages around or even move fields to different pages. It also doesn't matter if you include extra items accidentally, though you might want to check the test reports to make sure no necessary fields went unused.

If you get told a phrase is missing, read about a possible reason in the errors section. Then I SHOULD see the phrase \"some phrase\" Then I should NOT see the phrase \"some phrase\" The phrase should be inside double quotation marks and should NOT itself contain regular double quotation marks inside it.

Examples: (Moving) When I set the variable \"signature_date\" to \"today\" When I set the variable \"birthdate\" to \"today - 500\" When I set the variable \"court_date\" to \"today + 12\" Be careful with today math. If you're testing a \"boundary\" date, you want to pick a date that is well within a boundary to make the test more robust. For example, if you want to test a date that was 10 or fewer days ago, use today - 9 instead of today - 10. At some point your tests might run over midnight. In that situation, if you used 10 the clock would tip into the next day - 11 days from the filled-in date. Your test would fail incorrectly. In fact, your users might have that experience, so design your interview with that in mind. For example, you can tell them the date of the deadline so they too will know about the boundary.

For example, you can tap on collapsible content to show the text inside. When I tap the \"#an_id .al_toggle\" element and stay on the same page You might want to add a wait Step after that to let the contents become visible. For example And I wait .7 seconds.

The baseline PDF must be stored in your \"Sources\" folder along with your tests, and the downloaded PDF should have been downloaded by the above step (Then I download \"download.pdf\") earlier in the same scenario. Then I expect the baseline PDF \"baseline.pdf\" and the new PDF \"download.pdf\" to be the same This will compare all of the text in the baseline PDF with all of the text in the newly downloaded PDF, and then it'll compare the fillable fields of each.

The situations that need this are pretty rare, but here's an example: You navigate to a new page and set a field. Sometimes the test passes, but sometimes the test says an element on this page does not exist. The problem is probably that the page sometimes needs an extra few seconds to load.

It also has two main sections - the failed Scenarios and the Scenarios that passed. Within each of those, every Scenario will have its own section. In the Scenario's section, ALKiln will list the id of each screen where fields were set in the order in which they appeared. Under each screen id will be the names of the variables whose fields were set and the values they were set to. We're still working out some issues here. (Moving) If you used a story table Step, a Scenario might look more like this: --------------- Scenario: I fill in my name --------------- screen id: user-name | user.name.first | Maru | | | user.name.last | Plaintiff | | Rows that got set: And I get to the question id \"child information\" with this data: | var | value | trigger | | user.name.first | Maru | | | user.name.last | Plaintiff | | Unused rows: | defendant.name.first | Sam | | | defendant.name.last | Defendant | | Since story table Steps don't care about having extra unused rows, the report lets you know which rows did or did not get used. If rows are listed under \"Unused rows\", ALKiln couldn't find the fields for those variables during the test. Despite that, it was still able to get to the desired question id. You should check that section to make sure all your varibles got used. Rows are listed in alphabetical order. If you have thoughts on pros and cons, we'd love to hear from you. If everything looks right to you there, you can copy and paste the text under \"Rows that got set\" into your test to get rid of the extra rows you've got hanging around.

It means docassemble tried to get the value for a variable, but could not find where you defined the variable anywhere in your code or in the code you included or imported. Possible causes: It may be that you have not defined a variable in your interview or that you have not defined it in a way that docassemble can find it. That can be for many reasons. For example, maybe you are using an index variable or a generic object incorrectly or maybe you accidentally deleted the block where you were defining the variable. It may be that you have a typo either where you use the variable or where you define the variable. The typo may be in the value instead. It may be that you have a typo in a variable name or value in your test. It may be that you are setting the value incorrectly in your test. Checkboxes are especially complex fields to set. The mistake may have happened on a page much farther back than you expect with a field ALKiln skipped. Debugging: Sometime the easiest way to see what is wrong is to run the interview manually.

You might have a simple typo or you might have a perfectly normal misunderstanding of how to write variable names and values. You can check your test code for incorrect variable or value names in a few different ways. If you give every question in your interview an id, the report can help show you where the test failed or where ALKiln skipped setting variables. For each test, the report often has a list of question ids. For each question id, the report has a list of variables that ALKiln set on the page that had the error. If the test failed, you can see what question id the test got to. You can also check previous questions to see what variables are missing from each of those pages - what fields ALKiln skipped. It is more annoying, but in most cases1 you can copy the variable name from your test and search for it in your interview code. You can do the same for values of multiple choice questions. Alternatively, in most cases1 you can go through the interview manually, but follow this procedure: For every single page (even if you think this page has nothing to do with the problem), click on the </> in the nav bar to see the source of the page. Copy the name of the variable from your test and search for it on the page of the running interview. For multiple choice questions, do the same for the value. Use those values to answer the questions exactly as the test would answer them. Continue doing this till you find the problem. If you are unable to find the name of the variable or value in any other way, our last suggestion is the hardest to do, but most reliable - run the interview manually and inspect each page's HTML to find exact names. This is complex and we are happy to show you how to do this. Here is a refresher: Go to a new page. Click on the </> in the nav bar to see the source of the page. For every field in the page: If you cannot see the variable name or value, like for an object_checkbox field or a field created with code: Open the browser development tools. Examine the DOM of a field to find the encoded name of the variable. Use atob('the encoded name or id') with the encoded name or id to fully decode every part of the variable name. You may have to decode multiple times. From those decoded values, put together the variable name that you need to use. Copy the variable name and use your editor to search for that exact variable name in your test file. The variable name is the fully decoded and reconstructed variable name. In the final variable name, replace x, i, j, etc. with their actual values on that page. If the field is a multiple choice field like radio buttons, do the same for the value and use your editor to search for that exact value in your test file. Make sure it appears along with the correct variable name. For a checkbox field, the value is either True or False. Set the value exactly as the test would have set it.

If your phrase is missing there, try running the interview manually and see if it works. If it does, check the section on interviews that work when you run them manually. If it looks like the phrase is actually there, a diff checker can be your best friend. Use a diff checker like https://www.diffchecker.com/text-compare/ to copy/paste both the page's text and your test's text to check for differences. If the tool shows you differences, you can copy/paste the page's text into your test.

There are several possible reasons for this. For this type of error, it can be especially useful to look at the console logs and error messages. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for any test: You might have a gherkin syntax error somewhere in your test files. If this was the case, the setup should have completed and the test run should have started, but immediately failed. Find and fix that syntax error. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for GitHub+You™ tests: Your test server was unavailable. If this was the case, your GitHub job logs should show that the test setup failed. Check if the server is running now and run the tests again. Your docassemble developer account credentials were invalid. That is, the API key you created for the docassemble testing account and put in the DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY GitHub input may no longer exist. Maybe the API key got deleted in a docassemble server update. Maybe someone else changed it. You should create a new API key for that testing account and change the value of your DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY secret to the new value. You could also create a new testing account and create a new API key for the new account. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for GitHub Sandbox™ tests: The Docker container or the docassemble server installation is having trouble starting up. If this is the case, your GitHub job logs should show that the docker build step failed. This is a complex problem and takes experience with creating docassemble servers and maybe Docker. You can set the ALKiln SHOW_DOCKER_OUTPUT configuration input to \"true\" to show you more information about what is going on during that setup process. If you have experience with actions and the command line, you might also be able to use the tmate action to explore more about what is going on in your Docker container. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for GitHub+You™ and GitHub Sandbox™ tests: The package manager that installs ALKiln had a problem. This does happen every now and then. If this was the case, your GitHub job logs should show test setup failure. You can check its status, but the problem would have to be happening for a lot of people at once for it to show up.

First, there are reasons even passing tests can be slow, including: Your pages may just be taking a long time to load. This might happen if you are building a large document, uploading a large document, or for other reasons. That can even cause the tests to fail if it takes too long. You can use the \"max seconds\" Step to give them more time. There are some things you can do to speed up some kinds of processes on your server, but that is out of scope for this document. Downloading a lot of documents can take a while. Right now, ALKiln is unable to tell when a document is done downloading, so it gives every document the maximum time possible. By default, that is a full 60 seconds. You can decrease that time with the \"max seconds\" Step, but that time might be too short for the documents to download. You can experiment a bit. You can also be tricky with the \"max seconds\" Step, though, and increase and decrease the value at appropriate times to improve both speed and downloading. If your server reloads a lot during GitHub+You™ tests, it will take longer for tests to finish because the tests try to wait for the server to be available to avoid \"flaky\" tests. Your server can reload for many reasons. For example, saving your config file, saving a python module, or pulling a package that uses a python module can all cause your server to reload. This might even cause your tests to fail. There are also some different reasons that tests get slower when they fail, including: Each failing test gets re-run once, so that can double the amount of time that tests take. Currently, there is no way to choose whether to re-run tests or not. When a Story Table is trying to reach a target page and gets stuck somewhere, it will wait the maximum seconds allowed for a page load (which you can change) to let the interview continue to the next page. By default, that is 30 seconds.

There can be many causes for flaky tests. For example: Your server reloading during GitHub+You™ tests could make it impossible for your tests to reach your interview webpage. You just have to re-run those tests. A slow-loading interview page might make ALKiln think your server is unavailable. That can happen for different reasons. For example, a large document might be taking a long time to load. You might be able to avoid this failure by increasing the maximum wait time with the \"max seconds\" Step. That can make tests slower. You can be tricky about it, though. If you just increase that value for one Step and then reduce it again, that can avoid slowing down your tests too much. Tapping on an element might show content and move other elements around. ALKiln might fail to click on the elements that are moving. You can use the \"wait\" Step to give elements more time to finish moving. Third-party services, like GitHub or package managers, that the tests rely on do have problems every now and then. You just have to re-run those tests. An interview page rendering slowly can hide a field that ALKiln is trying to fill in. If we find that there is a particular type of field that is particularly slow to load, we can slow down ALKiln for that type of field, but that is the most ALKiln can do.

For example, someone's rental insurance might always be $50 each month. expense.times_per_year is the number of times each year that this amount occurs. If someone has to pay their landlord twice a month, times_per_year would be 24. This value can also be fractional if need be; an expense that only needs to be paid once every two years would have a times_per_year of 0.5. expense.source is the source, or name, of the expense. Food expenses could have a source of \"food\". expense.display_name is the name of the source that you want to display to the user. This helps with multi-lingual interviews, where you can show the user the name of the expense, but your interview logic can still refer to a single canonical language name. It also helps add or change additional context to the name that you don't want to write out in your interview logic. For example, expense.source could be \"medical insurance\", but expense.display_name could be \"Medical Insurance (including health, dental, and vision)\".

Using bootstrap.build is the simplest option for most authors. Visit the bootstrap.build website. Click the button to open the Builder Customize the options that you want to customize. Typically those will include: Under color system, the $gray/$blue/etc. colors, if you use a matching color in your theme Under color system, almost always the variables primary, secondary, success, info, warning, danger, light and dark Under Typography, customize any fonts that you wish to use Under forms, you may want to customize button size and rounded edges Click the \"export theme\" button (it may be hidden behind a banner at the top of the page) and choose the \"bootstrap.min.css\" option. Rename this theme to be more specific. Optionally, download the _variables.scss file so that you can easily load and adjust your settings in future. Next, you will need to make a small adjustment to the theme generated by bootstrap.build. Copy and paste the code below into the bootstrap.min.css file (or your new file name). .visually-hidden { clip: rect(0 0 0 0); clip-path: inset(50%); height: 1px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; white-space: nowrap; width: 1px; } .bg-dark { background-color: #1a73e8!important; /* replace with your desired nav bar color */ } Add this theme to your Docassemble playground using the Folders | Static menu.

If you prefer more control over building the theme, you can create a custom theme from the bootstrap source code. The Bootstrap documentation covers the details of theming if you want to take this approach. Create a new custom.scss file anywhere on your computer to contain the SASS/CSS styles for your branding. Detailed instructions on what this file can contain are in the Bootstrap documentation. You can use a color theme generator like Huemint.com to make sure that you have a consistent set of all 9 Bootstrap variables. When you use the color theme generator, at the bottom of the page, you will see a small snippet of code that you can copy into the customs.scss file. For example, your new custom.scss might look like this: // Custom.scss // Option A: Include all of Bootstrap // Include any default variable overrides here (though functions won't be available) $white: #ffffff; $theme-colors: ( \"light\": #d8e2a5, \"dark\": #1b1b1b, \"primary\": #25dec6, \"secondary\": #375b5a, \"info\": #d74d72, \"success\": #0cb545, \"warning\": #f4ca0b, \"danger\": #fa043c, ); // Note: we placed our custom.scss file in the bootstrap path for simplicity, // so we use a different path than in the bootstrap documentation // @import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\"; @import \"bootstrap\"; // Then add additional custom code here Once you have written your custom.scss file, you can use the ALDashboard (which you can install on your docassemble server) to compile a custom Bootstrap theme. If you are associated with the Suffolk LIT Lab and have an account on the Suffolk Development server, you can visit a live version of the tool to try it out. At the end of the tool, you can view what all of the different bootstrap components will look like with your theme. If you want to change any of the colors, you can go back and edit your \"custom.scss\" file and regenerate the bootstrap theme. Once you like the colors you've chosen, download the compiled file, and then add it a docassemble project, in the static folder. You can then reference your new file by adding a bootstrap theme feature to your interview: features: bootstrap theme: my_bootstrap_theme.css Running node and npm to build a Bootstrap config (optional)​ If you don't have access to a docassemble server yourself, you can also compile a bootstrap theme from source using node and npm. Use a computer with a current version of Node. The instructions on this page assume you are using an Ubuntu Linux computer with Node installed, but they should be the same on any workstation. They were tested on a machine running Windows 11 with Ubuntu running under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It also assumes that you have VS Code installed, but you can use any text editor of your choice. First, download the Bootstrap source, and install its dependencies. As of this writing, the latest version you should use is 5.1.3. wget https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v5.1.3/bootstrap-5.1.3-dist.zip unzip bootstrap-5.1.3-dist.zip cd bootstrap-5.1.3 npm install Place the custom.scss file you wrote from the above section in the unzipped bootstrap-5.1.3 folder, and use npm to compile the theme file. cd ~/bootstrap-5.1.3 npm run css-compile Your new custom.css file is in the ~/bootstrap-5.1.3/dist/css directory.

If you do not already have a .woff or .woff2 file but you do have a TrueType (TTF) or OpenType (OTF) file that you are licensed to distribute, you can create one with a free online web font tool. Once you have a .woff file, upload it to the /static folder of a Docassemble playground. Add an @font-face directive to your bootstrap.css file (or a separate CSS file that you reference in the features block of your interview) You cannot include Mako tags in your CSS file, so in order to use the new font face, you should add it to a Docassemble package and then install the package on your server. Example: @font-face { font-family: 'my_font'; src: url('/packagestatic/docassemble.MyTheme/my_font.woff2') format('woff2'), url('/packagestatic/docassemble.MyTheme/my_font.woff') format('woff'); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; } In the example above, MyTheme is a Docassemble package that is installed server-wide. my_font is both the name of a web font and the name of the WOFF file.","s":"Using custom fonts in the frontend","u":"/docs/components/ALThemeTemplate/overview","h":"#using-custom-fonts-in-the-frontend","p":890},{"i":907,"t":"If you would like to use a font other than the Microsoft fonts popular in the late 1990s-2000 era (Arial, Times New Roman, Courier) then you will need to install the fonts on your Docassemble server.

The first step is to locate the .otf or .ttf file representing the font that you want to use inside your Word template (note that these are often in c:\\windows\\fonts) Use the ALDashboard to install the font​ The ALDashboard tool has a widget that helps you install a font server-wide so it is available when a DOCX is converted to PDF. If you do not already have ALDashboard installed: Install the ALDashboard package via the global Package Management page (e.g., add https://github.com/suffolklitlab/docassemble-ALDashboard to the GitHub input field and click \"update\") Run it, either from the \"Dashboard\" menu item (if you added the menu shortcut) or by visiting /start/ALDashboard/menu on your server. Once you are at the ALDashboard menu page: Click the Install Fonts button. Drag and drop the OTF or TTF file on the upload target and click \"Continue\". The font should be available after a short wait.

You can often auto-complete the container name by hitting tab. Instead of copying the fonts to /usr/share/fonts, you could likely copy them to /var/www/.fonts.

Here is an example of a more complex test for a quick refresher on some of ALKiln's features: @children Feature: I have children @fast @child_benefits Scenario: child has benefits Given I start the interview at \"some_file_name.yml\" And I get to the question id \"benefits\" with this data: | var | value | | children.there_are_any | True | | children.target_number | 2 | | children[0].name.first | Cashmere | | children[0].name.last | Davis | | children[1].name.first | Casey | | children[1].name.last | Davis | When I set the var \"benefits['SSI']\" to \"True\" And I tap to continue Then the question id should be \"download\" And I download \"some_motion.pdf\"","s":"Quick refresher","u":"/docs/components/ALKiln/writing","h":"#refresh","p":934},{"i":941,"t":"Most of the code in test files is code for ALKiln Steps.

This tells you what information you should put in each of these blanks. In this case there are two blank spaces you should fill. In the first blank, you should put the name of the variable that the field will set. In the second blank, you should put the value that you want the variable to have.

Each of them must be the name of an environment variable that you have already added to your workflow file. The <username env var> variable should contain the username of a dedicated account on your docassemble server. The <password env var> variable should contain the password of that account. To use this Step: When you create a user for ALKiln on your docassemble server, note the email address and the password for that account. Create GitHub secrets or config values to store the email address and password. Example Step: Given I sign in with the email \"ALKILN_USER_EMAIL\" and the password \"ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD\" \"ALKILN_USER_EMAIL\" and \"ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD\" are just examples of environment variable names.

If you run your tests on GitHub, remember to use GitHub secrets to store this sensitive information. This is very similar to the \"sign in\" Step above. See that for basic information. The difference here is that you can also make sure that ALKiln deletes the interviews this user creates. The new blank to fill in is <api key env var>. It is the name of the environment variable containing an API key you create for the account that signs in. Example Step: Given I sign in with the email \"ALKILN_USER_EMAIL\" and the password \"ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD\", and the API key \"ALKILN_USER_API_KEY\" \"ALKILN_USER_EMAIL\", \"ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD\", and \"ALKILN_USER_API_KEY\" are just examples of environment variable names. You can use any names you want. See the \"sign in\" Step for more details. To set up the API key, do the following: Ask an admin on your docassemble server to create an API key for themselves in their user profile2. Use that admin API key to create an API key for your user by using the docassemble API endpoint. If you lose this API key, you can make a new one. You can do that in your terminal or command prompt with this code: $(curl -X POST \\ <your server url>/api/user/<user's email>/api \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \"key\": \"<your admin API key>\", \"name\": \"alkiln_key\", \"method\": \"none\" }') <your server url> is the url of your server in this format: https://your-server-url.org. <user's email> is the email of ALKiln's user account you name in your sign in Step. <your admin API key> is the API key your admin made.

The Step format: Given the maximum seconds for each Step is <number> The blank to fill in is <number> - the number of seconds to allow a Step to run, or a page to be filled, before the test fails. Example: Given the maximum seconds for each Step is 200 You can set the max seconds as your first Step to give a slow-loading interview more time to load. If you are worried about increasing the time too much, you can immediately decrease the time after the interview loads. For example: Given the maximum seconds for each Step is 200 And I start the interview at \"favorite_bears.yml\" And the maximum seconds for each Step is 30 You can also increase this setting before you try to download a large file. ALKiln spends twice the value of this setting to download a file. You can read more about the timing in the \"download\" Step. You can use this Step to change the maximum seconds setting at any time in your test. Increasing the maximum time can have down-sides. Some kinds of failures take the maximum amount of time possible. Since each failed test is re-run, those failing tests will take twice the amount of time that you set for your maximum Step time.

For example, if text is too small or if contrast between the text and its background is too low. If ALKiln found problems, the test will fail at the end. ALKiln uses aXe-core to check for problems.

It is the Step many of our authors work with the most. In our opinion, it is the most flexible way to fill in fields in your forms, unlike the linear \"I set\" Step. This makes a test easier to maintain. The Story Table Step is made of a sentence followed by a table. The data in the table is a snapshot of the user who is filling out the form. Each table row describes one fact about the user - one variable in the interview. It has this format: And I get to the question id \"<target question id>\" with this data: | var | value | | <variable name> | <value to set> | | <variable name> | <value to set> | As you can see, there are three types of blanks you need to fill in for this Step: <target question id> is the id3 of the question block where you want ALKiln to stop using this table. <variable name> is the name of an interview variable for a form field. Each table row needs one of these in the first column. <value to set> is the value to set for this row's variable name. The table must include all the variables and values necessary to get a user from the current page to the page with the given question id. The table must have two columns with the headings var and value. An example table: And I get to the question id \"brought scissors\" with this data: | var | value | | last_haircut_date | today - 730 | | wants_virtual_haircut | True | | user_name | Jaime | | intro_screen_accepts_terms | True | This Step is flexible, which makes the test easier to maintain. The order of the rows is unimportant. That means you can edit the order of your pages or move fields to different pages without worrying about breaking the test. ALKiln sets a table variable every time it finds that variable on a page, no matter how many times that variable appears in your interview. .there_is_another Avoid using .there_is_another in your Story Table. Read about using .target_number instead. Things to note You can use the Story Table generator to generate a first draft of a full test file. If your interview uses generic objects (x) or index variables (i, j, k, etc), you must have special HTML in your interview to set the values of variables. Right now, Story Tables are unable to use environment variables to fill in answers, so you cannot use them to set sensitive information like passwords. Unused rows The Story Table does not care about extra rows that never get used. This can make Story Tables easier to write, but it also means that the tests will technically \"pass\" even if variables that should get set are never filled in. That can be a sign that a question that the user should have seen got skipped or that there is a typo or mistake in the test. Because of this, the ALKiln report shows a list of unused rows for each table. You can check the report of passing tests to make sure none of the important rows got skipped. How this works, for the curious folks out there On each interview page, ALKiln: Checks if the page has the <target question id> you gave it at the start If the page does have the <target question id> it stops the Step Otherwise, it looks at each <variable name> in the var column to see if it can find that name in any fields For each <variable name> it finds, it tries to answer the field using the matching <value to set> On pages with show if fields, it waits to see if a new field appears If one does appear, it looks through each <variable name> again It sets any value it can and repeats this process When no new fields get revealed, ALKiln tries to continue to the next page If it is unable to continue it logs an error and stops Otherwise, it repeats the above ALKiln sets a table variable every time it finds that variable on any page, no matter how many times that variable appears in your interview.","s":"The Story Table Step","u":"/docs/components/ALKiln/writing","h":"#story-table","p":934},{"i":963,"t":"Use the \"I set\" Step to fill in one value on one page.

The first set of quotes in this Step contain the name of the variable you need to set. The second set of quotes contain the value you want to set. This is the same as the Story Table's's var column and value column. This Step is \"linear\". That is, unlike Story Table rows, these \"linear\" variable-setting Steps have to be in the correct order and you must make sure your test has reached the exact page that has the field.

Even though the name has \"GitHub\" and \"secret\" in it, it can also use environment variables. It is still the only way to use sensitive information in your tests. To do that, you can use environment variables with GitHub secrets. If your interview uses generic objects (x) or index variables (i, j, k, etc), you must have special HTML in your interview to set the values of variables. The format of the Step: And I set the variable \"<variable name>\" to the GitHub secret \"<environment variable name>\" Here, <variable name> is the name of the variable you want to set and <environment variable name> is the name of the environment variable that has the value. Example: I set the variable \"user1_account_password\" to the GitHub secret \"ALKILN_USER1_PASSWORD\" A lot of authors use this Step to set answers with sensitive information, like an account number. This is because ALKiln is extra careful with the security of these values. Since workflow environment variables might hold sensitive information, ALKiln avoids taking pictures or downloading the HTML of pages that use environment variables. It even avoids taking pictures when the test has an error on that page and during the sign-in Step.

Avoid boundary dates Be careful with today math. If you are testing a \"boundary\" date, you want to pick a date that is well within a boundary to make the test more robust. For example, if you want to test a date that was 10 or fewer days ago, use today - 9 instead of today - 10. At some point your tests might run over night and hit midnight right in the middle of the test - after ALKlin fills in the answer, but before the interview finishes. In that situation, if ALKiln answered the question with today - 10 the clock would tip into the next day by the end of the interview - 11 days from the filled-in date. Your test would fail incorrectly. The fact is, your users also might have that exact experience, so keep that in mind as you design your interview.

ALKiln is just fine with skipping extraneous table rows. If a field is optional and you don't want ALKiln to give an answer for it, leave out that row. Tip: You can use strict limitations to focus on important paths You can force the tests to focus on a specific path by only putting one option in a possible values column. You can do this to as many rows as you want. You can see the example above only gives one option for number_of_children—0. The author of this test wants to make sure ALKiln makes a good number of random tests that are just about users who have no children.

Not even you can see a secret in GitHub after you create it. In fact, GitHub redacts those values from your workflow logs. You can make secrets for individual GitHub repositories or you can make secrets for your whole GitHub organization. Once you have made the secrets, you might use them in combination with GitHub environment variables and for multiple reasons: Secrets are useful for creating values with sensitive information since no one can see those values. For example, with the \"sign in\" Step. Here is one example of using a secret in a workflow file: # other code env: ALKILN_USER_EMAIL: \"${{ secrets.ALKILN_USER_EMAIL }}\" ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD: \"${{ secrets.ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD }}\" job: # other code Remember to create a separate account for that \"user\". GitHub secrets are useful for sharing values between GitHub organization repositories. All the repositories of a GitHub organization can see its secrets, so you can affect all of those repositories at once from one location. Example situation For example, suppose Mo'nique has a GitHub organization named PolarisLaw. That organization has several repositories. Every test in every repository uses the value \"small_bear\" as an answer to a question. Next month, though, the firm might need to change that value to \"large_bear\". Mo'nique would have to edit that value in every test in every repository. Instead, she makes a GitHub secret in the PolarisLaw account called ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE and sets it to small_bear. Then she uses it in an environment variable she puts in all the workflow files in all the repositories. env: ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE: \"${{ secrets.ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE }}\" She can then use that environment variable in her tests: I set the variable \"bear_size\" to the GitHub secret \"ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE\" Next month, if PolarisLaw needs to change that value, Mo'nique can just edit the value of that secret and change it to large_bear. All the tests will use the new value without her changing anything else. Why not create secrets on your server for ALKilnInThePlayground™ tests? On your server all config values are already secret because only authorized people can see them, so they are just like any other environment variable.

By default, this will use the OpenAI API key defined in the global configuration under this path: You can specify the path to an alternative configuration by setting the openai_configuration_path attribute. This object does NOT accept the key as a direct parameter, as that will be leaked in the user's answers. open ai: key: sk-...

Arguments: input_width int, optional - The width of the input or display area. Defaults to 80. Returns: int - The maximum number of lines accommodated by the input width. value​ Retrieve the complete value without considering overflow constraints. This can be especially helpful in appendices where there's a desire to showcase the entire value without the necessity of toggling between various sections or pages. Returns: Any - The whole value of the field, irrespective of overflow. has_overflow​ Return True only if the value's length exceeds the overflow trigger. Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box. Defaults to 80. preserve_newlines bool - Determines whether newlines are preserved in the \"safe\" text. Defaults to False, which means all newlines are removed. This allows more text to appear before being sent to the addendum. _original_value Any - for speed reasons, you can provide the full text and just use this method to determine if the overflow trigger is exceeded. If no _original_value is provided, this method will determine it using the value_if_defined() method. preserve_words bool - If True, the algorithm will try to preserve whole words when truncating the text. If False, the algorithm will truncate the text at the overflow trigger, regardless of whether it is in the middle of a word. Returns: bool - True if the value's length exceeds the overflow trigger, False otherwise. original_or_overflow_message​ Return the original value if it is less than the overflow trigger (once processed), otherwise return the overflow message. Unlike safe_value(), this will never output a partial value. Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box.

If the value is not defined, return an empty string. When preserve_newlines is True, the output will be limited to a number of lines, not a number of characters. The max number of lines will be calculated as floor(self.overflow_trigger/input_width). Therefore, it is important that input_width is a divisor of overflow_trigger. Whitespace will be altered. If preserve_newlines is true, the return value may have newlines, but double newlines and Windows style (rn) will be replaced with n. Double spaces will be replaced with a single space. If preserve_newlines is false, all whitespace, including newlines and tabs, will be replaced with a single space. Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box.

Returns: str - The string representation of the value contained within the field. columns​ Return a list of the attributes present within the object that would make sense to go in the table of an addendum. If the headers attribute exists, this will be prioritized. Otherwise, the method will infer columns from the first value in the list. Empty attributes and the complete attribute are typically ignored. Arguments: skip_empty_attributes bool, optional - Determines whether empty attributes are included in the list. Defaults to True. skip_attributes Optional[set], optional - A set of attributes to ignore. Defaults to {\"complete\"}. Returns: Optional[list] - A list of columns or None if no meaningful columns can be determined. Notes: The \"location\" attribute of an Address object is always skipped in the column list. type​ Determine the data type of the contained value. Categories: 'list': A simple list. 'object_list': A list containing dictionaries or objects. 'other': Any other type. Returns: str - The type category of the value. is_list​ Check if the field contains a list value, whether it consists of objects, dictionaries, or standard values.

This is particularly helpful when there's a need to cache information on a per-page basis. The implementation leverages Docassemble's object pickling process by customizing the __getstate__ method that Pickle uses for serialization. Attributes: instanceName str - A unique identifier for the object instance, if available. __getstate__​ Overrides the default method used by Pickle for object serialization. If the object has an instanceName attribute, it is retained during serialization. Otherwise, an empty dictionary is returned, ensuring that other attributes are not persisted across page loads. Returns: dict - A dictionary containing only the instanceName if it exists, or empty otherwise.","s":"DALazyAttribute Objects","u":"/docs/components/AssemblyLine/al_document","h":"#dalazyattribute-objects","p":1200},{"i":1209,"t":"class ALDocument(DADict) A dictionary of attachments, either created by a DAFile or an attachment block. Typically there are three: The final version of a document with a signature. E.g., my_doc['final']. The preview version of a document with no signature. E.g., my_doc['preview']. An addendum of a document contained in the attribute addendum. E.g. my_doc.addendum. There is no limit to the number of keys, but the ALDocumentBundle class expects at least a \"final\" key to exist, and the addendum attribute is required if you desire to use PDF documents with text overflow. It is best practice to use exactly the two keys \"final\" and \"preview\" and the attribute \"addendum\". The \"final\" and \"preview\" documents will normally be the same template, but with logic controlling the display of a particular section, such as the signature. Each form that an interview generates should get its own ALDocument object. The \"addendum\" attribute can be handled in a generic object block. Multiple documents can use the same addendum template, with just the case caption varying. ALDocuments are designed to be used contingently as part of ALDocumentBundle objects. Each ALDocument is considered to be \"enabled\" or \"disabled\" for a particular interview user's session. This allows you to always work with a single object representing all of the possible documents an interview can generate, and use encapsulated logic to trigger individual documents inclusion on the final download screen. Attributes: filename str - name used for output PDF title str - display name for the output PDF enabled bool - if this document should be created. See examples. addendum DAFile | DAFileCollection - (optional) an attachment block overflow_fields ALAddendumField - (optional) ALAddendumFieldDict instance. These values will be used to detect and handle overflow. has_addendum bool - (optional) Defaults to False. Set to True if the document could have overflow, like for a PDF template. Notes: The enabled attribute should always be defined by a code block or the objects block, because by default it is considered fresh on each page load. If your interview logic requires that you directly ask the user whether or not to include a document, you can use a single intermediate variable that is posed to the interview user to work around this limitation. Examples - # TODO: the code blocks aren't working right yet on the Docusaurus page. Simple use where the document is always enabled and will have no addendum​ --- objects: - my_doc: ALDocument.using(filename=\"myDoc.pdf\", title=\"myDoc\", enabled=True) --- attachment: variable name: my_doc[i] # This same template will be used for the `preview` and `final` keys content: | Here is some content % if i == 'final': $\\{ users[0].signature \\} % elif i == 'preview': [ Your signature here ] % endif Enable a document conditionally​ --- # See that `enabled` is not defined here objects: - affidavit_of_indigency: ALDocument.using(filename=&quot;affidavit-of-indigency.pdf&quot;, title=&quot;Affidavit of Indigency&quot;) --- code: | affidavit_of_indigency.enabled = ask_indigency_questions and is_indigent An example enabling with a question posed to the interview user​ You should always use a code block or an object block to set the \"enabled\" status; Use an intermediate variable if you want to ask the user directly whether or not to include a document. --- question: | Do you want the extra document included? fields: - no label: include_extra_document datatype: yesnoradio --- code: | extra_document.enabled = include_extra_document --- attachment: variable name: extra_document[i] # This same template will be used for `final` and `preview` docx template file: extra_document.docx For a document that may need an addendum, you must specify this when the object is created or in a mandatory code block.

If not defined, the default term is the user's name. Returns: str - The appropriate subjective pronoun. pronoun_reflexive​ Returns the appropriate reflexive pronoun (\"herself\", \"themself\", \"myself\"), based on the user's pronouns or gender and whether we are asked to return a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person pronoun. Note that if the person has pronouns of they/them/theirs or a nonbinary gender, we return \"themself\" as the singular non-gendered reflexive pronoun and not \"themselves\". This has growing acceptance although some consider it nonstandard. See: https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/themself Arguments: **kwargs - Additional keyword arguments that are defined upstream. person (Optional[[Union[str,int]]): Whether to use a first, second, or third person pronoun. Can be one of 1/\"1p\", 2/\"2p\", or 3/\"3p\" (default is 3). See upstream documentation for more information. default (Optional[str]): The default word to use if the pronoun is not defined, e.g. \"the agent\". If not defined, the default term is the user's name. Returns: str - The appropriate reflexive pronoun. name_full​ Returns the individual's full name. If the person has the attribute person_type and it is defined as either business or organization, it will only return the first name, even if middle, last, or suffix are defined. Returns: str - The individual or business's full name. name_initials​ Returns the individual's name with the middle name as an initial. Equivalent to name.full(middle=\"initial\"), which is also the default. Defined only to make it possible to be explicit about the name form. If the person has the attribute person_type and it is defined as either business or organization, it will only return the \"initials\" of the first name, even if middle, last, or suffix are defined. Returns: str - The individual's name with the middle name as an initial. name_short​ Returns the individual's name without any middle name. Equivalent to self.name.firstlast() If the person has the attribute person_type and it is defined as either business or organization, it will only return the first name, even if middle, last, or suffix are defined. Returns: str - The individual' familiar​ Returns the individual's name in the most familiar form possible. The purpose is to allow using a short version of the individual's name in an unambiguous way in the interview. For example: referring to the child in a guardianship petition by first name instead of \"the minor\". But there may be a problem if context doesn't make it clear if you are talking about the child or their parent when they share a name. In order, it will try to use: just the first name the first name and suffix the first and middle name the first and last name the full name the default value, e.g., \"the minor\", if provided the full name If the person has the attribute person_type and it is defined as either business or organization, it will only return the first name, even if middle, last, or suffix are defined. Arguments: unique_names Optional[List[Any]] - A list of unique names to compare against. Defaults to None. default Optional[str] - The default name to return if no unique name is found. Defaults to None. Returns: str - The individual's name in the most familiar form possible. Example: Who do you want to take care of $\\{ children.familiar(unique_names=parents + petitioners, default=\"the minor\") \\} __str__​ Returns a string representation of the individual, which is their full name with the middle name shortened to one letter. If the individual has the attribute person_type and it is defined as either business or organization, it will only return the first name, even if middle, last, or suffix are defined. Returns: str - The individual's name. section_links​ Returns a list of clickable navigation links without animation. Arguments: nav - The navigation object. Returns: List[str] - A list of clickable navigation links without animation. will_send_to_real_court​ For legacy email to court forms, this checks to see if the form is being run on the dev, test, or production server. The text \"dev\" or \"test\" needs to be in the URL root in the DA config: can change in /config. Returns: bool - True if the form is being run on the dev, test, or production server. filter_letters​ Used to take a list of letters like [\"A\",\"ABC\",\"AB\"] and filter out any duplicate letters. Avoid using, this is created for 209A. Arguments: letter_strings Union[List[str], str] - A list of letters. Returns: str - A string of unique letters. fa_icon​ Return HTML for a font-awesome icon of the specified size and color. You can reference a CSS variable (such as Bootstrap theme color) or a true CSS color reference, such as 'blue' or 'DDDDDD'. Defaults to Bootstrap theme color \"primary\". Arguments: icon str - The name of the icon to use. See https://fontawesome.com/icons for a list of icons. color str - The color of the icon. Defaults to \"primary\". color_css Optional[str] - A CSS variable or color reference. Defaults to None. size str - The size of the icon. Defaults to \"sm\". Returns: str - HTML for the icon. is_sms_enabled​ Checks if SMS (Twilio) is enabled on the server. Does not verify that it works. See https://docassemble.org/docs/config.html#twilio for more info. Returns: bool - True if there is a non-empty Twilio config on the server, False otherwise is_phone_or_email​ Returns True if the string is either a valid phone number or a valid email address. If SMS is not enabled on the server (through the Twilio config), only accepts emails. Email validation is extremely minimal--just checks for an @ sign between two non-zero length strings. Arguments: text str - The string to check. Returns: bool - True if the string is either a valid phone number or a valid email address. Raises: DAValidationError if the string is neither a valid phone number nor a valid email address. github_modified_date​ Returns the date that the given GitHub repository was modified or None if API call fails. Will check for the presence of credentials in the configuration labeled \"github issues\" in this format: github issues: username: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME token: YOUR_GITHUB_PRIVATE_TOKEN If those credentials aren't found, it will then search for credentials in this format (deprecated): github readonly: username: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME password: YOUR_GITHUB_PRIVATE_TOKEN type: basic If no valid auth information is in the configuration, it will fall back to anonymous authentication. The GitHub API is rate-limited to 60 anonymous API queries/hour. Arguments: github_user str - The GitHub username of the repository owner. github_repo_name str - The name of the repository. auth Optional[dict] - A dictionary containing authentication information. Defaults to None. Returns: Union[DADateTime, None]: The date that the given GitHub repository was modified or None if API call fails. language_name​ Given a 2 digit language code abbreviation, returns the full name of the language. The language name will be passed through the word() function. Arguments: language_code str - A 2 digit language code abbreviation. Returns: str - The full name of the language. safe_states_list​ Wrapper around states_list that doesn't error if passed an invalid country_code (e.g., a country name spelled out) Arguments: country_code str - A 2 digit country code abbreviation. Returns: List[Dict[str, str]]: A list of dictionaries with field prompts for states. has_parsable_pronouns​ Returns True if the pronouns string can be parsed into a dictionary of pronouns. Arguments: pronouns - a string of pronouns in the format \"objective/subjective/possessive\" Returns: True if the pronouns string can be parsed into a dictionary of pronouns, False otherwise parse_custom_pronouns​ Parses a custom pronoun string into a dictionary of pronouns. Arguments: pronouns - a string of pronouns in the format \"objective/subjective/possessive\" Returns: a dictionary of pronouns in the format {\"o\": objective, \"s\": subjective, \"p\": possessive} get_visible_al_nav_items​ Processes a list of nav items and returns only the ones that are not hidden. Can be used to control the visible nav items in a more declarative way while keeping the navigation dynamic. Expects a list like this: data = [ {\"key\": \"value\", \"hidden\": True}, \"top level item\", {\"key2\": [{\"subkey\": \"subvalue\", \"hidden\": False}, {\"subkey\": \"subvalue2\", \"hidden\": True}]}, ] Arguments: nav_items - a list of nav items Returns: a list of nav items with hidden items removed","s":"ALIndividual Objects","u":"/docs/components/AssemblyLine/al_general","h":"#alindividual-objects","p":1234},{"i":1247,"t":"A guided interview is always an intervention into one part of a larger process.

ALDocumentBundle objects can be nested to allow you to group multiple individual template files into one document that the user can download. Both ALDocument and ALDocumentBundle objects can be either enabled or not.

There are usually exactly two keys in the dictionary: preview and final, with the only difference being the presence or absence of a signature. Conditional logic inside the template or attachment block can be used to show or hide the signature depending on the value of the key so that the template does not need to be created twice. The signature_if_final method of an ALIndividual was created to simplify this common use case. Here's how to use an ALDocument: Create ALDocument objects in an objects block. Set any required attributes, like enabled, in the object block or in a separate code block. If you set enabled=True in the object block, your document will always be enabled. Define the key of the ALDocument in an attachment block using the variable name modifier. Usually, use one attachment block and define the variable name like this: variable name: some_al_document[i]. Optionally, reference the ALDocument inside an ALDocumentBundle. Example: --- objects: - letter: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"ssa_letter\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False) --- attachment: - pdf template file: ssa_letter.pdf variable name: letter[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) }","s":"ALDocument class","u":"/docs/components/AssemblyLine/ALDocument/overview","h":"#aldocument-class","p":1267},{"i":1273,"t":"If other variables in your interview determine if your document is enabled, you should define the enabled attribute in a code block, like this: --- objects: - main_document: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"main_document\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False) - insurance_rider: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"rider\", has_addendum=False) --- attachments: - pdf template file: main_document.pdf variable name: main_document[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } - pdf template file: rider.pdf variable name: rider[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } --- code: | if total_cost > 1000: insurance_rider.enabled = True else: insurance_rider.enabled = False # or more concise but slightly harder to read: # insurance_rider.enabled = total_cost > 1000 In the example above, the insurance_rider document is only included in any bundles if the total cost of the project is over $1,000. Note that the enabled value is global for the interview session. If you want to use different logic in different bundles, you can easily create a separate ALDocument that references the same template file and attachment block. Attributes: filename: the display filename used for the document when it is downloaded title: the title shown on the download screen enabled: whether the document should be \"turned on\" when it is referenced in an ALDocumentBundle addendum: points to a variable representing an attachment block with a formatted addendum. The Assembly Line provides a good default addendum template that is flexible enough to work with many fields. overflow_fields: an ALAddendumFieldDict with each representing a field that has potential to be sent to the addendum if exceeds a pre-set length. has_addendum: set this to True or False to control whether the overflow_fields dictionary will be checked to decide whether or not to generate an addendum file. Optional; defaults to False. Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a PDF version of the completed template and any addendum. key is normally preview or final as_docx(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a DOCX version of the completed template and any addendum if the original is a DOCX template. key is normally preview or final. as_list(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a 1 or 2 item list which contains the template and its addendum, if any. need_addendum(): returns True if the addendum exists and there are overflow fields. has_overflow(): returns True if there are fields that trigger the addendum. overflow(): returns a list of just the fields that triggered the addendum. safe_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"safe\" value of field_name (the amount that is less than overflow_trigger) plus an overflow message. Used in an attachment block. overflow_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"unsafe\" value of field_name--the amount that exceeds the overflow_trigger.

Here's how to use an ALDocumentBundle: Create the ALDocumentBundle in an objects block. Add each ALDocument or nested ALDocumentBundle that your interview will sometimes produce to the bundle. Because the list is usually known in advance, it's common to include this in the object definition. Use the as_pdf() method on your preview screen to display a preview of the output without any signature. Use the download_list_html() and send_button_html() methods on your download screen. You can have as many or as few bundles as you would like. The Assembly Line convention is to use the following two bundles: al_user_bundle which should include a next steps document with instructions for your user al_court_bundle which leaves out the instructions and should have every document that you want the clerk to receive Stick with this convention if you expect to integrate with E-filing. Example: --- objects: - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[ssa_next_steps, letter]) - al_court_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[letter]) note You can nest ALDocumentBundles! Just create your bundle in a separate objects block and add it directly into the list of elements. This lets you create a document from multiple templates that you want the user to be able to open and print as one file. Attributes: enabled (optional): define this if the bundle is included inside another ALDocumentBundle. If other variables in your interview determine if it's enabled, you should define the attribute in a code block, like in this earlier example title: this is displayed on the download screen filename: used to construct the display filename for a pdf version of the bundle Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> DAFile: return a single concatenated PDF of the bundle's attachments as_zip(self, key:str = 'final', refresh:bool = True, title:str = '') -> DAFile: returns a compressed ZIP archive with separate documents for each item. enabled_documents(self, refresh:bool=True) -> List[Any]: return a list of only the \"enabled\" documents in the bundle as_flat_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: get_titles(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[str]: as_pdf_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: as_editable_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: download_list_html(self, key:str='final', format:str='pdf', view:bool=True refresh:bool=True, include_zip:bool = True, view_label=\"View\", view_icon:str=\"eye\", download_label:str=\"Download\", download_icon:str=\"download\", zip_label:str=None, zip_icon:str=\"file-archive\") -> str: returns HTML for a table with download and view buttons, as for a download screen send_button_html(self, key:str='final', show_editable_checkbox:bool = True)->str: send_email(self, to:any=None, key:str='final', editable:bool=False, template:any=None, **kwargs) -> bool: Example of a download screen that uses an ALDocumentBundle: --- progress: 100 id: download event: petition_to_change_name_of_adult_download question: | Your form is ready to download. subquestion: | Thank you ${ user_name_first_new }.

It displays the signature if and only if i == 'final'. phone_numbers() displays either mobile_number, phone_number, or both if both are present for use in a PDF form with only one space to list phone numbers. contact_methods() displays a list of the contact methods the user provided in the default question library \"contact information\" screen as a formatted string. Specifically, it will display mobile_number, phone_number, email, and other_contact_method. This may be helpful in a formatted letter. age_in_years() returns the individual's age as an integer (whole number), calculated from the individual's birthdate attribute. formatted_age() is like age_in_years() but returns a formatted string with years, months, weeks, and days included when relevant. The cutoff is 2 weeks to display days, 2 years to display months, and anything over 2 years displays only years. name_fields(person_or_business:str = 'person', show_suffix=True) is like address_fields() and is used to display a list of either 3 or 4 fields for a person's name. See Names address_fields() is a wrapper around the address_fields() method of an ALAddress with the same parameters. gender_fields(show_help=False) is like the address_fields() method but displays a list of vetted gender options. Read more about gender questions. pronoun_fields() displays a question that allows the user to provide their pronouns, with multiple choice and a fill-in-the-blank option. See pronouns. initials() is used to return a string with the 1, 2, or 3 initial letters of a person's name. E.g., QKS for Quinten K Steenhuis. language_fields(choices=List[Dict[str, str]]) provides a language selector that sets the .language attribute of the user, together with an other fill-in. This should be the two-letter ISO language code.

We use this in the examples. It should be fine for most real-world interviews. If your interview is already bit slow, note that using reconsider: True can add a small slowdown to every page load. One alternative to avoid this slowdown is to list all of the variables that can invalidate the current menu's accuracy with the depends on modifier. This is a fine tradeoff (adds a tiny bit of maintenance), and it works for most scenarios. As an example of where it won't be sufficient: depends on will not trigger an update when the items in a list change. If depends on is not enough, you could still save a little page load time by explicitly triggering the navigation to be rereshed at defined points in the interview flow. This works well when you have a linear interview and don't allow editing the answer to questions that could change the navigation. Even if you do have this issues, you could force reloading the definition of al_navigation_sections in the \"edit\" button. To set up this more manual refreshing, you'll want to do this in a separate code block, not directly in the interview order block.

Arguments: font_name str - The name of the font to search for (without path). search_dirs List[str] - A list of directories to search. Returns: Optional[str] - The full path to the font file if found; otherwise, None. get_font​ Loads a font by name from candidate directories and returns an ImageFont instance. If font_name is provided, it may be either a full path to a font file or a font name (without a path). In the latter case, the function will search for the font in /var/www/.fonts and /usr/share/fonts/truetype/, automatically appending '.ttf' if necessary. If no font is found, the function falls back to the default Pillow font. Arguments: font_name Optional[str] - The desired font's full path or name. Defaults to None. font_size int - The size of the font to be used. Defaults to 48. Returns: ImageFont.ImageFont - The loaded font instance. create_signature​ Creates an image file that simulates a signature. The signature image is generated by combining the provided signature_prefix (for example, \"/s/\" or \"s/\") with the person's name. The text size is measured to create an image with appropriate dimensions, and then the text is drawn onto a white background. The final image is saved to the specified output file path. Arguments: name str - The person's name to be signed. output_file str - The full file path where the image will be written. signature_prefix str - The signature prefix to use (e.g., \"/s/\" or \"s/\"). Defaults to \"/s/\". font_name Optional[str] - The font's full path or name (without path). Defaults to None. font_size int - The size of the font to be used.

Setting exclude_newly_started_sessions to True will exclude any results from the list that are still on \"step 1\". Note that while this may be useful to filter out interviews that were accidentally started and likely do not need to be resumed, it will also have the side effect of excluding all answer sets from the results.

Used in interview_list.yml to allow overriding some of the labels in the interview list with options specified in the global configuration. top_level_config should be reserved to handle backwards compatibility (e.g., changed location of some configuration keys) Example configuration, showing both the single-string and language-specific string options: assembly line: interview list: title: en: In progress forms es: Formularios en progreso short title: My forms Arguments: config_key str - The config key to look up. The config can be a single string or a dictionary with language keys. top_level_config_key str, optional - Optional, alternative top-level config key to look up. Defaults to None. Returns: str - The value of the config key, or the alternative key, or None. get_filenames_having_sessions​ Get a list of all filenames that have sessions saved for a given user, in order to help show the user a good list of interviews to filter search results. Arguments: user_id Optional[Union[int, str]], optional - User ID to get the list of filenames for. Defaults to current logged-in user. Use \"all\" to get all filenames. global_search_allowed_roles Optional[Union[Set[str], List[str]]], optional - Roles that are allowed to search for all sessions. Defaults to admin, developer, and advocate. Returns: List[str] - List of filenames that have sessions saved for the user. get_combined_filename_list​ Get a list of all filenames that have sessions saved for a given user. If it is possible to show a descriptive name for the filename (from the main dispatch area of the configuration), it will show that instead of the filename. The results will be in the form of [{filename: Descriptive name}], which is what the Docassemble radio button and dropdown list expect. Arguments: user_id Optional[Union[int, str]], optional - User ID to get the list of filenames for. Defaults to current logged in user. Use \"all\" to get all filenames. global_search_allowed_roles Optional[Union[Set[str], List[str]]], optional - Roles that are allowed to search for all sessions. Defaults to admin, developer, and advocate.

Handling court hierarchies is a complicated task, and something that the AssemblyLine can't do for you. You'll need to make your own way to let users select what court they want to file in depending on your jurisdiction. See our documentation for al_courts for some possible ideas. You should be able to run the interview now. If this is the first time you're running the interview on the server, you will be asked to log in to eFileIL. If you don't yet have an account, you should be able to make a new pro-se user account with eFileIL by following the links to make a new account on the page. Once you've logged in on the server, subsequent runs of the interview won't ask you to log in, until the eFileIL token expires and you have to log in again, in about 1-2 hours. The next page will ask if you want to search by party name or by case number. For now, let's search by case number. If you select \"case number\", and then enter the case number \"2022SC9\", you should find a case, John Smith vs. Bob Doe, a small claims case. info This case search worked at the time of writing (February 28th, 2023). However, courts have removed older cases from their staging servers before, and it is possible that this search won't work in the future. You can try searching common names like \"John Brown\" or \"John Smith\", or you could ask a court official if they are able to provide you with some testing case numbers from their staging server. We recommend that you build a working relationship with your local courts so they can help you with details like this. You can also go back and search by \"Party name\" instead. You can enter the name \"John Smith\", press continue, and wait. Searching by party name takes longer on eFileIL's server, especially on the staging server, you might have to wait around 30 seconds. Once the search completes, you will see that there are many cases involving John Smith. For speed purposes, the EFSP library only gets information about the first 8, and let's you click the next button to see the next 8. If you select the John Smith vs. Bob Doe case, you then see the last page in the interview YAML; show_all_info. This page shows all of the information that you, the interview author, can use from the case_search.found_case, the variable for the found case. The details and case_details attributes aren't stable APIs, but you might find the following attributes useful: court_id, the court that this case came from. Some courts have sub-courts that handle specific case types, so even though you searched for cases in the \"adams\" court, you should use this value for the rest of the interview. participants, an ALPeopleList object that has all of the participants in the case on both sides. each participant has a party_type and party_type_name, i.e. participants[0].party_type_name might be \"Plaintiff/Petitioner\". These values are Tyler e-filing codes that are set by the court. attorneys is a dictionary that contains any attorneys that are a part of the case. efile_case_type is the Tyler e-filing code for the type of case. This is useful if your interview is only relevant for certain case types. If users don't or can't fill out your form for their case, you can send users to a page that says they don't need this form and why. docket_number has the case number of the court. \"Docket number\" is the term that Massachusetts uses for a unique number assigned to each case by the court. You might know it as \"case number\".

Including the add_existing_users line triggers code in the EFSPIntegration package that asks the user which participant they are in the case, and then fills in users and other_parties based on that information. If your form generally deals with party types other than \"defendant\" and \"plaintiff\", you will likely want to look at the is_defendant_filters and is_plaintiff_filters variables in docassemble-EFSPIntegration:case_search.yml which you can override to sort participants by their codes from a case into your typical ALPeopleLists in your form.","s":"Using case search data in your Assembly Line interview","u":"/docs/components/EFSPIntegration/case_search","h":"#using-case-search-data-in-your-assembly-line-interview","p":1522},{"i":1533,"t":"Functions that help convert the JSON-ized XML from the proxy server into usable information. error_notification​ Copied from docassemble.webapp.server.error_notification, since: things from webapp.* are unstable it breaks the unit tests and the mypy Some slight modifications to work without server backends log_error_and_notify​ Similar to docassemble.webapp.server.error_notification, which will send an email to the error_notification_email in the config. convert_court_to_id​ Converts a court type to the specific id string expected by Tyler.

To keep it simple, the interview will only file one type of case; this lets us hardcode a few pieces of information in our interview. We'll first need to find the right \"codes\" for our interview. Tyler's E-filing system defines specific codes for many different parts of the filing process, include the over-arching category of the case, the more specific case type, and even things like whether or not the filed document should be confidential or not. You will usually need to lookup the case category and the case type. The docassemble integration allows some fuzzy matching based on the name of the case type or category, because codes can change without warning. But in some cases, you will want to specify the exact code. Therefore, you will want to note and enter both the name and the associated code for both case category and case type. https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/ has a fairly complete interface to help you locate codes. But: You might need to write down a code you get at one step to effectively use it as a required parameter or in the endpoint URL in a follow-up search. One common example is the court's name. The court code is often required to be part of the endpoint's path. Court codes are often the same as the court's name, but may have a slight variation. You can look up the court code. Some of the endpoints require that you add a URL parameter. URL parameters follow standard GET rules, with the first parameter needing a ? and each following parameter separated by an &. The value for each parameter follows a =. E.g., ?paramater1=value&parameter2=value Find the jurisdiction and start browsing services and codes​ Locate the jurisdiction you want by visiting https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/. You can click on the URL next to the jurisdiction name to visit the page for that jurisdiction's courts. Find the \"GetCodesService\" link to browse all available codes. For example: https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/. Find the code for a court​ Find the code for the court that you want to file in by visiting the \"GetCourts\" link. It may help to add the parameter ?with_names=true. For example: https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/courts?with_names=true. Note: the available paramaters are documented on the previous page, with the link to each available service. Note the appropriate court code. For example, \"appeals:acsj\" is the code associated with \"Appeals Court - Single Justice (J Docket)\". Find the case category name and code​ Go back to the \"GetCodesService\" link (https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/) and click the example link for the getCategories service. You will need to edit the URL to place the proper court code in the URL. For example: https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/courts/appeals:acsj/categories, where appeals:acsj is the court code. Note the case category's name and code. For example: Case category \"Appeals Court Single Justice - Civil\" has the associated code 8151. Find the code for the case type​ To get the code for a case type, we need to look at the case types available for a specific category associated with a specific court. Visit the getCaseTypes service. Edit the example URL to specify both the court code and a category ID. For example: https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/courts/appeals:acsj/case_types?category_id=8151 Look through the list of codes and pick the appropriate code. For example, for a \"MAC Rule 6.0 – Motion to stay\" the code is 101447. Note that some jurisdictions may use the same case type code for all cases of the same type, across all courts. But at least one jurisdiction, Illinois, uses different codes in different courts. The most recent version of the efiling_integration.yml provided by docassemble-EFSPIntegration allows you to reference the filing code by name to resolve this problem, but some fuzzy matching may be necessary because even the name for the case type can have variations in Illinois. Find the code for the filing type​ In addition to a case type that describes the whole \"envelope\", individual documents inside the case type have their own codes. Use the getFilingTypes endpoint to get a list of available filing types and their associated codes. For example: https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/courts/appeals:acsj/filing_types. You can search in the page for the matching filing type. For example, for \"Rule 6.0 Motion to Stay\" the filing type is 101450. Assuming that your Docassemble interview allows filing exactly one case type and category, the efiling_integration.yml file will expect to find the codes defined this way: code: | efile_case_category_filters = ['Appeals Court Single Justice - Civil', 'Civil'] efile_case_category_default = '8151' efile_case_category_exclude = None efile_case_type_filters = ['Rule 6.0 Motion to Stay'] efile_case_type_default = '101447' efile_case_type_exclude = None The filing type is defined at the bundle level (note you can have as many bundles as you choose in a given interview). #### Complete example -- Illinois single court adoption codes For example, say we want to write an Adoption interview. The codes in Illinois are split by courts, so to see the case categories available to one particular court, say Adams, we can go to [https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/categories](https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/categories), and scroll through the responses until we find the \"Adoption\" entry, code 7306. We would then see the case types for Adoption cases in adams at [https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/case_types?category_id=7306&timing=Initial](https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/case_types?category_id=7306&timing=Initial), which is 25361. The endpoints should say when they need parameters, like we provided with `category_id=7306&timing=Initial` above. For this guide, we'll stick with a single court, to make things simple to understand. We'll use the following codes: variable name | purpose | example value | example meaning ---------|-----------|-----------|------------- `efile_case_category` | the over arching category of the case | `\"7306\"` | Adoption `efile_case_type` | the specific type of case | `\"25361\"` | Adoption `efile_case_subtype` | optional, if there needs to be more specific case types | N/A | N/A `party_type` | what the role of an individual or party is in the case | `\"7067\"` or `\"20640\"` | Adoptive parent or child `filing_type` | what the filing actually is, usually the name of the document | `\"29730\"` | Application `document_type` | If the document is confidential or not | `\"5766\"` | Non-confidential `filing_component` | If this is the lead document or if it's an attachment | `\"332\"` | Lead document ### Give all of the info that the EFSP needs to file your doc Now that we have all of the codes that we want, we need to define the right variables, setting their values to the codes we found above. Your interview must define the list of `ALIndividual`, `users` and `other_parties`. Each individual should have at least a first name. Note that if only a first name is provided, then the person is assumed to be a business. `users[0]` is almost always the person completing the interview, or at least who the form is being completed on behalf of. For each object in `users` and in `other_parties`, your interview needs to define the following attributes: * `party_type`: this should be the Tyler party type code of that user * `is_new`: if you are filing into an existing case and are adding additional participants to the case, this should be true. They aren't necessary since this interview is making an initial case (where all parties are implicitly new). * `users[0].email` must be defined. Email is not required for any other parties. ```yaml code: | trial_court = 'adams` efile_case_category = '7306' efile_case_type= '25361' --- code: | users[i].name.first if i == 0: users[i].email users[i].party_type = '7067' # adoptive parent users[i].completed = True --- code: | other_parties[i].name.first other_parties[i].party_type = '20640' # adoptive child other_parties[i].completed = True The following variables must also be defined: user_started_case: an Assembly Line variable determining if the users are plaintiffs/petitioners. lead_contact: this is the person who will be contacted about the status of this filing, and can just be set to users[0]. tyler_payment_id: This is the payment information that Tyler needs to collect payment for the filing. It is the string of the payment method ID. We'll deal more with this in the advanced guide (coming soon), but for now, we'll assume that the filer qualifies for a fee waiver, and can use the global waiver payment account, \"global\" meaning that any filer can use when filing. You can get this waiver payment account from the config: get_config('efile proxy', {}).get('global waiver', ''). al_court_bundle should be an ALDocumentBundle, containing all of the documents that you want to file. Each top level ALDocument or ALDocumentBundle in al_court_bundle will be treated as a separate filing, and each filing needs the following attributes: filing_component and filing_type filename: this will be defined by default when declaring the ALDocument filing_parties: these are the parties that are initiating the filing. When the party that's filing is also being added in that filing, the value is the instanceName of docassemble var representing that individual.

They may include a choice, creating a narrative, or even applying legal reasoning. \"Affidavits\" are a special form of created answers. See Jarret and Gaffney, Forms That Work (2008) classify_field​ Apply heuristics to the field's original and \"normalized\" name to classify it as either a \"slot-in\", \"gathered\", \"third party\" or \"created\" field type. get_adjusted_character_count​ Determines the bracketed length of an input field based on its max_length attribute, returning a float representing the approximate length of the field content. The function chunks the answers into 5 different lengths (checkboxes, 2 words, short, medium, and long) instead of directly using the character count, as forms can allocate different spaces for the same data without considering the space the user actually needs. Arguments: field FieldInfo - An object containing information about the input field, including the \"max_length\" attribute. Returns: float - The approximate length of the field content, categorized into checkboxes, 2 words, short, medium, or long based on the max_length attribute.

It is hand-written for now. It will factor in the input type, the answer type (slot in, gathered, third party or created), and the amount of input text allowed in the field. The return value is a function that can return N samples of how long it will take to answer the field (in minutes) time_to_answer_form​ Provide an estimate of how long it would take an average user to respond to the questions on the provided form. We use signals such as the field type, name, and space provided for the response to come up with a rough estimate, based on whether the field is: fill in the blank gathered - e.g., an id number, case number, etc. third party: need to actually ask someone the information - e.g., income of not the user, anything else? created: a. short created (3 lines or so?) b. long created (anything over 3 lines) cleanup_text​ Apply cleanup routines to text to provide more accurate readability statistics. text_complete​ Run a prompt via openAI's API and return the result. Arguments: prompt str - The prompt to send to the API. max_tokens int, optional - The number of tokens to generate. Defaults to 500. creds Optional[OpenAiCreds], optional - The credentials to use.

If tools_passive​ Ping passive voice API for list of sentences using the passive voice get_passive_sentences​ Return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a sentence in which passive voice was detected along with a list of the starting and ending position of each fragment that is phrased in the passive voice. The combination of the two can be used in the PDFStats frontend to highlight the passive text in an individual sentence. Text can either be a string or a list of strings. If provided a single string, it will be tokenized with NTLK and sentences containing fewer than 2 words will be ignored. get_citations​ Get citations and some extra surrounding context (the full sentence), if the citation is fewer than 5 characters (often eyecite only captures a section symbol for state-level short citation formats) get_sensitive_data_types​ Given a list of fields, identify those related to sensitive information and return a dictionary with the sensitive fields grouped by type. A list of the old field names can also be provided. These fields should be in the same order. Passing the old field names allows the sensitive field algorithm to match more accurately. The return value will not contain the old field name, only the corresponding field name from the first parameter. The sensitive data types are: Bank Account Number, Credit Card Number, Driver's License Number, and Social Security Number. substitute_phrases​ Substitute phrases in the input string and return the new string and positions of substituted phrases. Arguments: input_string str - The input string containing phrases to be replaced. substitution_phrases Dict[str, str] - A dictionary mapping original phrases to their replacement phrases. Returns: Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, int]]]: A tuple containing the new string with substituted phrases and a list of tuples, each containing the start and end positions of the substituted phrases in the new string.

This tool helps you solve steps 3 and 4; users submitting feedback to you, and you being able to triage that feedback. Since much docassemble development already involves GitHub, the AssemblyLine uses GitHub's issues to handle and triage feedback. GitHub issues let you tag user feedback as such, link issues to PRs that fix the code, and track when the fix has been added to the code. GitHub is more developer focused, but it's a good tool to use if you don't currently track interview issues.

If you want to be able to make issues on repositories from different organizations, you'll need to list each of them here. For example, Suffolk additionally hosts interviews made by MassLegalHelp. This is so users can't use your tool to spam issues on other organizations' GitHub repos. feedback session linking helps you as the server administrator debug tricky bugs. If this is set to True and if the user agrees, the feedback interview will save the session ID of their current interview on the server and link it to their feedback issue on github. This means that you can see the state of their interview when the user ran into their problem, making it easier to reproduce and fix their bug. You can browse the linked sessions in browse_feedback_sessions.yml. ask panel will add a question to the feedback interview, asking users if they want to be in a panel for user testing.

First, find an interview you'd like to add a feedback widget to. Where exactly you want to ask for feedback is up to you, but we'd recommend doing it where a user has reached an end point.

The metadata can include things like a case number, the names of parties, and codes that tell a clerk what kind of filing is being delivered. E-filing replaces delivering documents to the court by hand, mail, or courier. Traditionally, e-filing requires visiting a dedicated web page, creating an account, converting documents into PDF format, and then inputting a lot of confusing information, such as document type, filing codes, and court codes. The LIT Lab's primary tool is code that guided interview authors can incorporate to add a simple one-click e-file button into an existing guided interview. The interview author can pre-select or help the litigant select the proper codes. This removes the most challenging part of traditional e-filing. If the litigant qualifies for a fee waiver, they may not even be required to create an account. We have also created a very simple e-filing \"portal\" that works much like traditional e-filing websites. This is not a product we expect end-users to interact with just yet. There are many competing systems of e-filing, but often there is a monopoly vendor within a given jurisdiction. Often, the vendor may have a program that allows third-parties to deliver documents to the vendor. Then, the vendor takes care of delivering the document the rest of the way to the court's docket. If you think of the e-filing vendor as a corporate mail room, then third-party vendors like the Suffolk LIT Lab are the equivalent of UPS or FedEx. We just get the document to the building. The e-filing vendor handles getting it to the right desk. From a court clerk's point of view, the filing looks just like a filing uploaded through the vendor's first-party system.","s":"What is e-filing?","u":"/docs/components/EFSPIntegration/overview","h":"#what-is-e-filing","p":1620},{"i":1626,"t":"The LIT Lab is a certified EFSP, or Electronic Filing Service Provider, for the Tyler Technologies system.

There are additional states that use Tyler as the monopoly vendor but do not have a current EFSP agreement in place. In two states Suffolk LIT Lab has started conversations to be the first participants in a new EFSP program. The LIT Lab also has a bespoke integration with Jefferson Parish's JeffNet, an in-house e-filing tool built for Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.

An advantage of Google Analytics and Segment is that the data will be stored for the long term and you do not need to worry about persisting it between server outages or upgrades, nor about retaining information long term on your server. A disadvantage is that they rely on well-known user tracking tools that may be blocked by ad-blocking or other security software, so the usage statistics may not be completely accurate. To use this integration: Make sure each question in your interview has an id. The id specifier will be added automatically to interviews created with the Assembly Line Weaver. Example: id: this is the google or segment analytics id question: | What is your name fields: - Name: user_name Sign up for Google Analytics or Segment, and follow the Docassemble documentation to enable tracking with the system of your choice. This integration allows for very basic tracking. You can identify popular interviews, screens, and dropoff points. Perhaps the most important thing to track is to assign an id named download to your download screen. Then, inside Google Analytics, you can search for the keyword \"download\" under Behavior | Site Content | All pages. Note that the \"page url\" in Google Analytics will have the name of the package and YAML file inserted into the URL.

The default stores only the zip code, but if you remove all parameters, the user's full interview session will be captured in a simplified state.

Forward thinking courts have readability targets of 6th grade. But because people don't just read forms--they answer questions and follow instructions--readability isn't a very good measure of form complexity, at least not on its own: Forms use lots of short text (like: Address, Name, and so on), while readability scores are designed to evaluate long narratives. Litigants answer questions and follow instructions on forms as well as reading words. Answers can require getting information from a third party, finding a specific piece of paper (like an ID card), doing math, or making a decision. Answers can be very sensitive, either because they are about private information, like a Social Security Number, or because they evoke a traumatic response, like details of an assault. Answers come in different formats, too. The difference between checking a box and writing out a long answer is significant. Complexity and sensitivity can't always be avoided. For example: a complaint asking for protection from abuse needs to disclose some information about the abuse. But forms should never impose a burden on the litigant that doesn't have a matching benefit.","s":"Why readability scores aren't good enough","u":"/docs/components/RateMyPDF/overview","h":"#why-readability-scores-arent-good-enough","p":1682},{"i":1694,"t":"We built the RateMyPDF score by combining feedback from: Form automators Form authors Legal aid experts Court staff And our own in-house experience from building the Document Assembly Line.

Work with the decisionmaker and subject-matter experts to research the process and intended users. Consider developing user personas. Make sure the deciscion maker and key subject-matter experts agree with your understanding before you move on to design. Document the process​ An online guided interview is a single step in a larger and more complex process. Start by researching that process from beginning to end—especially what happens before and after someone completes your interview. It always helps to interview someone with experience and observe while someone goes through the process, or both. Process documentation checklist Identify the user's ultimate goal Review the relevant law and procedure List the documents the interview must assemble Create a flowchart of the process from beginning to end, including: What must have happened in order for someone to use this interview What the user will have to do after completing the interview List the pieces of information the user will have to provide to complete the interview, and classify each according to the Jarrett-Gaffney framework: Slot-in information the user already knows, like their own name and address Gathered information the user will look up from a readily available source like a court notice or a government ID (that you can tell them they will need before they start!) Third-party information the user will get by calling someone or looking it up in a database (make a list of the sources of this information) Created answers the user will make on the spot User research and personas​ Describe the intended user of the interview. Legal knowledge Assistance Education level Languages they can speak Languages they can read and write Reading comprehension level Time available Access to technology (computer, smartphone, printer, etc.) Reliable internet access Stress or trauma involved in this process Consider creating 2 or 3 user personas that together describe likely interview users. Considering design and development problems from the perspective of your user personas can give you insight into what actual users will need from it. warning If your user personas are too general, they won't be help you focus. If they are too specific, they can result in blind spots and missed opportunities. Even if your personas are about the right specificity, watch out for blind spots—details that could lead to a poor experience for other likely users. In the sample persona below, for example, \"Maria\" is a single mother. That's a helpful detail for understanding what someone facing eviction might be experiencing, but you probably wouldn't want to build an eviction defense tool that assumes all users are single mothers. To strike the right balance, each user persona should reflect about 20–30% of likely users. Then, if you create 2 or 3 user personas, they should cover the majority of likely users. Even so, when you always check for blind spots when referring to a persona=!

The decisionmaker should sign off on the requirements as well as any flowcharts or wireframes. Identify the project requirements/MVP​ Start by listing the requirements for your project—what it must do to be acceptable. Remember that you are building the first version of this interview, and you can iterate and improve on it in the future. Start by building something that works, using the minimum viable product concept as a guide. Minimum viable product (MVP) First make something that works, then make it better. Consider Henrik Kniberg's skateboard analogy: Different projects will have different MVPs/skateboards. The LIT Lab's legal form maturity model is a framework for thinking about online guided interview MVPs. For interviews built for legal professionals, level 1.5 is usually enough. Interviews built for the general public should usually target level 2+. Levels 3 and 4 are mostly meant for future iterations. An MVP can be as simple as a list of requirements. Sample MVP requirements for a court form Maturity model target level: 2 The user can correctly complete every field/blank on the form The interview flows like a natural-language intake with a new legal aid employee The form identifies users who cannot use the firm as early as possible, and gives them an \"off-ramp\" The interview uses branching logic to skip unnecessary questions and provide a logical flow Compound questions are broken up into separate screens The user is not asked for the same information twice The interview correctly populates every field on the form The user can sign on their computer or phone screen Questions are written in plain language (for a 6th-grade reading level) The user will be offered a next-steps document to download The interview has been approved by key subject-matter experts The interview has been tested rigorously with a combination of scenario-baesd user testing, random input testing, or automated testing Once the decisionmaker agrees on the requirements, stick to them. Don't add requirements without a compelling justification. Use flowcharts or wireframes​ Flowcharts and wireframes allow you to \"sketch\" the interview you plan to build. They may not be necessary for very simple interviews, but they are worthwhile if your interview has conditional elements or unique questions. A flowchart illustrates the branching logic of an interview and can help identify hidden complexities early on. For example, a flowchart would be helpful to illustrate: Whether the user qualifies to use the interview/court form Which form or sections of the form the user must complete Whether to ask particular follow-up questions Which values should be provided to which variables in which circumstances Whether additional information or documents should be included in the output Which court the user should file in Which filing codes to use A low-fidelity wireframe is a simplified prototype of a user interface element that emphasizes function over form. Wireframes are helpful if you need to design a new type of form element (i.e., one that does not already exist in the question library). Pen and paper works fine for flowcharts and wireframes, but there are plenty of software tools available. Consider using one that lets you save your flowchart or wireframe in a format you can save along with the interview.","s":"Design","u":"/docs/get_started/project_management","h":"#design","p":1784},{"i":1795,"t":"Once the decisionmaker has signed off on the requirements/MVP and any flowcharts or wireframes, it's time to start building the interview!

Internal feedback​ Before you show the interview to the decisionmaker and stakeholders, get someone with Document Assembly Line experience to test it with you. This will help you identify issues you may have missed and questions you still need to ask the decisionmaker. tip If you aren't sure where to find someone to give you preliminary feedback, try asking the community! Come to one of the Monday community meetings or ask in the Microsoft Teams forum. Schedule a video meeting with the tester. You can demonstrate it for them, or you can watch them go through the interview. Record the test if you can so you can focus on the feedback and asking follow-up questions instead of taking notes. During the demo: Remind the tester that they are testing the interview; they are not being tested (and neither are you!) Encourage the tester to comment on all aspects of the interview Ask them to follow different branches of the interview logic Listen carefully to their feedback and ask follow-up questions to make sure you understand it External feedback​ Once you have closed all the issues that are in scope for the MVP and tested the interview yourself, it should be ready to hand off to the decisionmaker and stakeholders for their testing and feedback. Share the interview with the decisionmaker and give them a few tips for giving helpful feedback: The feedback should come in the form of a written list of requested changes If there is confusing or conflicting feedback from stakeholders it is the decisionmaker's responsiblity to clarify it before presenting it to the interview building team Change requests should be specific. For example, if the text of a question should be changed, the change request should include the new text. At the top of each page of the interview is an ID. Use the ID to refer to specific interview pages, not a page number. info Two rounds of external feedback and revision are usually enough to get you to the point where you just have a punch list of final tasks to do before the interview is ready for launch.","s":"Feedback","u":"/docs/get_started/project_management","h":"#feedback","p":1784},{"i":1799,"t":"When the interview is complete, there is one last decision for the decisionmaker to make: whether the interview is ready to go live.

The retrospective format comes from Agile software development, and it is a way to embrace continuous improvement by taking a moment to reflect on the project you just finished in order to improve the next one. If your interview project fails, a retrospective is an important tool for making sure you avoid another failure. To do a retrospective, the project manager should meet with each member of the group to discuss and document the answers to three questions: What went well that we should keep doing? What did not go well that we should stop doing? What should we try going forward? Retrospectives are generally most effective one-on-one, in real time. tip Insist that everyone give at least one answer to each question. Even if someone insists nothing went badly, ask if they found themselves confused or struggling at any point during the project. Their answer may lead to an area that could be improved. Use what you learn from the retrospective when planning your next interview-biulding project. Success metrics​ Consider measuring the success of your project in terms of: Time saved by those who use the tool People helped as a percentage of total filings of the same type Closing an access gap by enabling people to do something they couldn't before You can use the InterviewStats package to track usage. Usability tests, reading grade level measurements, and auditing for best practices can help you understand how your interview has affected the access gap. Transfer documentation​ Before you set the project aside, take some time to help the next developer—which might be you! One of the best places to store information and documents for the next developer is in the GitHub repository.

For example, in the LIT Clinic, students demonstrate their interview in class, followed by 10–15 minutes of real-time feedback.

It's also possible to do standups asynchronously, but only if your team works well that way. Daily check-ins are common on active projects, and anything less than weekly is unlikely to be effective. Standups should follow a straightforward standing agenda. Each person on the team shares: Progress: what they worked on or accomplished since the last meeting Plan: what they are working on now Blockers: anything preventing them from making progress The reason for sharing your progress and plan for the day or week is so that everyone is aware of what everyone else on the team is working on. This is necessary for the project manager, and can help interview builders avoid merge conflicts or identify when it's time to merge branches. The reason for sharing blockers is to get help. Some teams reserve a larger block of time and use it to solve blockers together, like we do in our Monday community meetings. Other teams prefer to solve blockers separately. And sometimes a blocker is a question you need answered by the decisionmaker before you can move forward. tip Consider incorporating our Monday community meetings into your standup schedule.

If you add a question label to issues, it is easy to pull up the list of your questions during a meeting. Tips for asking questions To get better answers, ask questions better: Don't ask a question if you don't need the answer. Before you ask the decisionmaker, ask your interview-building team or consult your style guide or other internal documentation. Avoid open-ended questions. Intead, give the decisionmaker options and explain the pros, cons, and implications of each. If you must ask an open-ended question, explain that you are trying to generate ideas, not come up with the solution right then and there. Don't ask the decisionmaker to design the interview. It is usually better to clarify goals or requirements (\"Do you need the attorney's ID number?\"), not details (\"Do you want the ID number field to show up right under the attorney's name field?\"). Remember: if you ask a question you will get an answer. If you don't need an answer, asking for one is not likely to help, and you may get an answer that complicates the project instead of helping you move forward. Finally, when showing the relevant part of the interview to illustrate a question, remind the decisionmaker and stakeholders that the interview is a work in progress and you are not ready for feedback beyond the answer to your question.","s":"Decisionmaker check-ins","u":"/docs/get_started/project_management","h":"#decisionmaker-check-ins","p":1784},{"i":1821,"t":"You will need to communicate outside of meetings, of course.

We recommend: asking for gender using inclusive language providing information that lets the user understand the consequences of selecting an inclusive option that cannot be printed on the output document The following gender options are ones that we researched and identified as striking a balance of inclusivity and representative of real-world forms in jurisdictions that have adopted inclusive language: Female Male Nonbinary (note spelling which is the most accepted usage, without a hyphen) Prefer to write something else Prefer not to say Unknown We also recommend including this warning language if the form does not provide a place to write in an inclusive option: Some forms require you to select either \"Male\" or \"Female\". If you do not select \"Male\" or \"Female\", your form may include an empty checkbox. We intentionally avoid the use of the word other which is dehumanizing and not inclusive. However, some forms do use other, and it may be appropriate to use any option that is not Female or Male to check an Other box, depending on the use and value of requesting gender on the form. For example: when identifying a respondent in an abuse protection order petition, using a gender description that matches the apparent gender of the respondent is something the petitioner should consider to aid police in serving the petition.","s":"Provide gender choices that respect identity","u":"/docs/style_guide/question_library/gender","h":"#provide-gender-choices-that-respect-identity","p":1871},{"i":1875,"t":"We do not hesitate to edit forms that request gender in an unhelpful way when the same information could be provided in an inclusive way.

The Assembly Line team settled on these choices: she/her/hers he/him/his they/them/theirs ze/zir/zirs (the \"i\" is a short \"i\" as in \"sir\") Remember, pronouns may be different from gender. Do not try to use one question to get both. One person may have one gender identity and multiple sets of pronouns. Always include an option for someone to describe their own pronouns. Allow a litigant to select multiple sets of pronouns.
