However, you may have very good reasons to collect usage information: Your users might all be inside a single organization rather than consumers You may need to collect anonymous statistics to report to a funder You may be an entity like a court or tribunal and need the information for a legitimate purpose, to serve the user or litigant's needs","s":"Overview","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/analytics/tracking_usage","h":"#overview","p":17},{"i":23,"t":"Docassemble has a native integration with both Google Analytics and Segment. Google is widely used and free, but usage is reported to Google and used for purposes of selling advertisements. Segment is a commercial analytics tool with a paid tier. An advantage of Google Analytics and Segment is that the data will be stored for the long term and you do not need to worry about persisting it between server outages or upgrades, nor about retaining information long term on your server. A disadvantage is that they rely on well-known user tracking tools that may be blocked by ad-blocking or other security software, so the usage statistics may not be completely accurate. To use this integration: Make sure each question in your interview has an id. The id specifier will be added automatically to interviews created with the Assembly Line Weaver. Example: id: this is the google or segment analytics idquestion: | What is your namefields: - Name: user_name Sign up for Google Analytics or Segment, and follow the Docassemble documentation to enable tracking with the system of your choice. This integration allows for very basic tracking. You can identify popular interviews, screens, and dropoff points. Perhaps the most important thing to track is to assign an id named download to your download screen.

Very basically, you tell the story table Step what question you want to get to and the variables and values it will need to get there. Whenever the test gets to a page, it checks your story table for any variables that match a variable on the page. When it finds a match, it sets the value of the field. When it's done with a page, it continues to the next page until it reaches the terminal question.

Avoid noyes type fields. For one thing, the story table generator code will need less editing. For another, we've found that humans tend to find those confusing too. If your package is not importing specifically al_package.yml from the styled Assembly Line package, make sure to add the trigger variable code to your interview. You can write tests that just go part-way through an interview. That way, you can work on adding more content and yet also be sure that the work you've already done isn't affected by the new changes.

Example: ---id: introquestion: | Social Security Overpayment Waiver or Changesubquestion: | This website can help you ask the Social Security administration to 1. **lower the amount that must be paid back**, or; 1. **change the schedule of payments** for someone who is told that they owe the Social Security Administration money. ${ collapse_template(overpayment_waiver_help_template) }continue button field: intro_screen---template: overpayment_waiver_help_templatesubject: | More information about an overpayment waivercontent: | When Social Security says that you have an overpayment they are saying that you got more SSI or SSDI than you should have gotten under their rules. The reason Social Security says you have an overpayment is in the Notice of Overpayment. Docassemble has many features that allow you to add help in-context. They include: the question help button the glossary terms feature the under area the field hint modifier that adds placeholder text the field help modifier the option help modifier Through expert feedback, we have determined that the question help button should never be used. The placement of the button and the use of a separate mode for help text can be confusing. Help may also come \"too late\" with this feature, after a user has already completed answering the questions on screen. We also discourage use of the hint modifier that adds placeholder text to a field. Multiple references discourage this feature. The under feature can be a helpful place to add additional context to a screen, although the field-specific note feature may be more consistent with user expectations across multiple questions. The glossary terms feature should be used cautiously, perhaps with additional CSS to make it more distinctive. The risk with this feature is distracting or confusing users. The field and option help modifiers are both relatively clear and simple to use for field-specific hints and to explain choices that may otherwise not be clear. Custom CSS may make these features slightly more polished than the stock Docassemble appearance.","s":"Adding help in context","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/coding_style_guide/yaml_interface","h":"#adding-help-in-context","p":284},{"i":293,"t":"On this page","s":"Collecting items in lists","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/coding_style_guide/yaml_lists","h":"","p":292},{"i":295,"t":"Try to gather items in a list in a way that would be natural to do in a conversation. For example: if you ask about income, you might naturally ask: do you work? Do you have any other jobs? Do you have any pension income? If you ask about children, it may be more natural to ask: do you have any children? How many? And then ask for the information of each child one at at a time.

After each item, the user needs to answer \"are there any more?\" It's also important to reflect back the number of currently gathered items so someone does not get lost in trying to remember which items they have already told the system about. It works well when the number of items is not important to the user. For example, people usually know the number of children they have. They can count the number of bank accounts or income sources they have, but it's not a number they have in their mind already. Consider adding a table or list of the children at the end as a summary/check that they did the entry correctly. Ask for items with the \"list collect\" feature​ Appropriate when adding multiple items is not likely, the user does not necessarily know the total number of items in advance or asking for a total number would be awkward, and there are only a few fields necessary to collect each item.

Copy it into your own YAML file and make the changes that you want. You will need to type the --- separator. Paste it into a logical place, such as near other questions that are asked at about the same time in your YAML file. About the variable x If the question you want to customize uses the keyword generic object, delete that line from the question. Also replace the variable x with a specific variable name, like users[0]. A second way to customize the question is to look to see if it is listed as one of the playground Example blocks. In the Playground, scroll down until you see the heading \"Example blocks\". Expand the menu labeled \"Suffolk LIT Lab Assemble Line\" and look to see if the block you want is listed. Click the green \"insert\" button to insert it at the position of your cursor in the Docassemble playground. Replace any variable names to match the variable name you want to customize. For example: replace person with users[0]. You may or may not want to delete any objects block that comes along with the custom question.","s":"Questions that you will not see in the Playground","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/customizing_interview","h":"#questions-that-you-will-not-see-in-the-playground","p":335},{"i":351,"t":"If you are prompted to specify if the user is the plaintiff or defendant but the user always is starting a new action, customize the value of al_form_type.

We might call lamp a prefix and red a suffix, though that kind of language might get complicated if we get into things like lamp_red_tall. These label rules work like that too - you'll combine prefixes and suffixes to build your labels, so look out for that pattern: prefix_suffix Note: Every field label in a PDF has to be unique. They cannot be repeated. We'll talk more about that later, but it's good to remember.

For example: in a Motion to Vacate Default Judgment, the user of the form is always going to be the defendant. In a form that creates a new case, the user of the form is always going to be the plaintiff or petitioner.","s":"Figure out who is using your form","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/document_variables","h":"#figure-out-who-is-using-your-form","p":356},{"i":367,"t":"Label parties to the case with party-specific labels​ The person who is using your form and the person who your form's user is opposing should always get one of the special labels below: Note: We made PDF labels singular because you can't work with lists in many PDF editors. DOCX variables representing people are all plural. Internally, all variables representing people are plural. PDF label DOCX label Use case user users, user[0], or user[n] (where n is any whole number; use sequentially Will display the full name of the person who is filling out the online form other_party other_parties, other_parties[0], or other_parties[n] The person suing or being sued by the person filling out the form; someone on the \"other side\" of the case. plaintiff plaintiffs, plaintiffs[0], plaintiffs[n] Plaintiff in the case if we don't know if the plaintiff is the user or other party. defendant defendants, defendants[0], defendants[n] Defendant in the case if we don't know if the defendant is the user or other party. petitioner petitioners, petitioners[0], petitioners[n] Petitioner in the case if we don't know if the petitioner is the user or other party. respondent respondents, respondents[0], respondents[n] Plaintiff in the case if we don't know if the plaintiff is the user or other party. If the form has room for two people on one side of the case, you can reference user1 and user2 (on a PDF) or users[0] and users[1] (in a DOCX). It's important to always use one of these 4 labels for people who are actually part of the case, since we use those internally in many many places in our standard questions and to communicate information to the court. Never use names like: Tenant Landlord Parent etc. that can be converted into party labels, like Plaintiff or Defendant, if the form is being used by the tenant or landlord or parent. Every form should have at least one of the 6 party labels above. It's best to use user/users and other_party/other_parties when you know that the form is always used by a plaintiff or defendant. For example, a form that is always used by a tenant in an eviction case will normally get labeled with user/users any place that the form mentions either tenant or defendant. In any form that starts a new case, we can always label the PDF with user where the plaintiff name goes. Use one of these exact prefixes for other \"people\" on the form when at all possible​ You may want to use other kinds of labels on the form for miscellaneous people who are associated with the form, but are not parties to the case. Using one of these labels below that we have pre-selected tells our tool that these are people, so we can handle things like addresses, birthdates, etc. correctly. We can freely add more labels to this list if you need them for your form. Ideally, talk to us about that before running your form through the weaver. Never use any of the labels below when the person identified by the label is a party to the case. For example, if they are the person using the form or the person who is on the opposing side of the case from the user of the form. PDF label DOCX label Use case spouse spouses, spouses[0], spouses[n] A spouse whose information goes on the form but is not a party to the case. child children, children[0], children[n] Any child whose information goes on the form. parent parents, parents[0], parents[n] A parent who is not a party to the case. guardian guardians, guardians[0], guardians[n] A guardian who is not a party to the case. caregiver caregivers guardian_ad_litem guardians_ad_litem attorney attorneys translator translators witness witnesses debt_collector debt_collectors creditor creditors These are are considered the prefixes we described before. unknown_role isn't something our program will account for, but it's a name you can use when you don't know what role name to use. It can remind you (or alert other folks) to get a consult from someone who would know more. People suffixes​ When these are people, they have similar things we want to record about them. For example, their first name (name_first). These will be our suffixes. When a field is for a plaintiff's first name, you will combine the two: plaintiff_name_first. These are pre-defined words you can use as field labels for a plaintiff: Label to use in the PDF When to use it plaintiff Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's full name plaintiff_name The same - label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's full name plaintiff_name_first Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's first name plaintiff_name_middle Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's middle name plaintiff_name_last Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's last name plaintiff_name_suffix Label for a field that asks for the suffix of the plaintiff's name plaintiff_gender Label for a text field asking for the plaintiff to write in their gender plaintiff_gender_female Label for a checkbox for a \"female\" gender choice plaintiff_gender_male Label for a checkbox for a \"male\" gender choice plaintiff_birthdate Label for a single field for the plaintiff's date of birth CONTACT INFORMATION plaintiff_address_address Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's house address plaintiff_address_unit Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's apartment number (deprecated) plaintiff_address_street Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's house address. Use plaintiff_address_address instead (deprecated) plaintiff_address_street2 Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's apartment number. Use plaintiff_address_unit instead plaintiff_address_city Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's city address plaintiff_address_state Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's state plaintiff_address_zip Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's zipcode plaintiff_email Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's email address plaintiff_phone Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's phone number SIGNATURE What if you need to use a field again, though? As we said, each field label in a PDF needs to be unique, but some forms ask for a field multiple times. For example, the plaintiff's name might come up more than once. In those cases, you add two underscores (__) and a number. This will go on the very end of the label, after all the suffixes. So, prefix_suffix__2, prefix_suffix__3, and so on: Label to use in the PDF When to use it plaintiff_name_first__2 Label for the second field that asks for that plaintiff's first name plaintiff_name_first__3 Label for the third field that asks for that plaintiff's first name plaintiff__2 Label for the second field that asks for that plaintiff's full name plaintiff__3 Label for the third field that asks for that plaintiff's full name And so on. How about the other person/organization types you told me about? All these pre-defined suffixes work the same for all of the person/organization types we listed.

Also, we can do some automation with custom labels too if they follow certain patterns. Important Rules​ Some things you really need to do or it will be very hard to write code for the labels: Field names must start with a letter or underscore (_) - not a number or anything else. Field names can only include letters, numbers, and underscores. No spaces or any other character. When you run across a large area that gives room for writing a paragraph, make sure it's one big field. Useful label conventions​ Code is also about communicating with each other. The label names you come up with now are ones people will need to work with in the future. You don't have to do too much, but try not to label things with Adobe's defaults or field1, field2, and so on. Here are some suggestions for making helpful labels: Please use all lowercase letters for all labels. The coders will really appreciate it. Separate multiple words in a label with an underscore: plaintiff_does_love_pie Make the labels descriptive. If they can be descriptive and short, that's even better. Avoid acronyms and abbreviations, other than very common ones such as id for identification. When you have several related fields in a row, it could help with automation if you make your own prefix and suffixes. Make a prefix out of the the feature that groups them together, e.g. asset_checking, asset_savings, etc. It makes alphabetical sorting easier. Additional suffixes to help with automation: Use verb/noun pairs for checkboxes. For example, plaintiff_is_parent, defendant_speaks_spanish, petitioner_has_assets, etc. For checkboxes with a yes/no pair, add _yes and _no to the end as an extra suffix. E.g., defendant_knows_english_yes and defendant_knows_english_no - prefix_suffix_suffix","s":"Custom field labels","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/document_variables","h":"#custom-field-labels","p":356},{"i":377,"t":"Thank you for joining us to help make a difference in people's lives!","s":"Thank you!","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/document_variables","h":"#thank-you","p":356},{"i":379,"t":"Again, don't try to memorize these.

ALDocumentBundle objects can be nested to allow you to group multiple individual template files into one document that the user can download. Both ALDocument and ALDocumentBundle objects can be either enabled or not. The Docassemble interview will seek logic that defines when the document should be included in the final output, letting you easily create interviews that have contingent documents.","s":"Overview","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/aldocument","h":"#overview","p":430},{"i":436,"t":"An ALDocument is a DADict that has top level attributes and points to one or more Docassemble attachment blocks. There are usually exactly two keys in the dictionary: preview and final, with the only difference being the presence or absence of a signature. Conditional logic inside the template or attachment block can be used to show or hide the signature depending on the value of the key so that the template does not need to be created twice. The signature_if_final method of an ALIndividual was created to simplify this common use case. Here's how to use an ALDocument: Create ALDocument objects in an objects block. Set any required attributes, like enabled, in the object block or in a separate code block. Define the key of the ALDocument in an attachment block using the variable name modifier. Usually, use one attachment block and define the variable name like this: variable name: some_al_document[i]. Optionally, reference the ALDocument inside an ALDocumentBundle. Example: ---objects: - letter: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"ssa_letter\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False)---attachment: - pdf template file: ssa_letter.pdf variable name: letter[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } Example: It's common in longer interviews to have the enabled attribute be defined in a code block, like this: ---objects: - main_document: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"main_document\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False) - insurance_rider: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"rider\", has_addendum=False)---attachments: - pdf template file: main_document.pdf variable name: main_document[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } - pdf template file: rider.pdf variable name: rider[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) }---code: | if total_cost > 1000: insurance_rider.enabled = True else: insurance_rider.enabled = False # or more concise but slightly harder to read: # insurance_rider.enabled = total_cost > 1000 In the example above, the insurance_rider document is only included in any bundles if the total cost of the project is over $1,000. Note that the enabled value is global for the interview session. If you want to use different logic in different bundles, you can easily create a separate ALDocument that references the same template file and attachment block. Attributes: filename: the display filename used for the document when it is downloaded title: the title shown on the download screen enabled: whether the document should be \"turned on\" when it is referenced in an ALDocumentBundle addendum: points to a variable representing an attachment block with a formatted addendum. The Assembly Line provides a good default addendum template that is flexible enough to work with many fields. overflow_fields: an ALAddendumFieldDict with each representing a field that has potential to be sent to the addendum if exceeds a pre-set length. has_addendum : set this to True or False to control whether the overflow_fields dictionary will be checked to decide whether or not to generate an addendum file. Optional; defaults to False. Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a PDF version of the completed template and any addendum. key is normally preview or final as_docx(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a DOCX version of the completed template and any addendum if the original is a DOCX template. key is normally preview or final. as_list(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a 1 or 2 item list which contains the templaate and its addendum, if any. need_addendum(): returns True if the addendum exists and there are overflow fields. has_overflow(): returns True if there are fields that trigger the addendum. overflow(): returns a list of just the fields that triggered the addendum. safe_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"safe\" value of field_name (the amount that is less than overflow_trigger) plus an overflow message. Used in an attachment block. overflow_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"unsafe\" value of field_name--the amount that exceeds the overflow_trigger.

Here's how to use an ALDocumentBundle: Create the ALDocumentBundle in an objects block. Add each ALDocument or nested ALDocumentBundle that your interview will sometimes produce to the bundle. Because the list is usually known in advance, it's common to include this in the object definition. Use the as_pdf() method on your preview screen to display a preview of the output without any signature. Use the download_list_html() and send_button_html() methods on your download screen. You can have as many or as few bundles as you would like. The Assembly Line convention is to use the following two bundles: al_user_bundle which should include a next steps document with instructions for your user al_court_bundle which leaves out the instructions and should have every document that you want the clerk to receive Stick with this convention if you expect to integrate with E-filing. Example: ---objects: - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[ssa_next_steps, letter]) - al_court_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[letter]) note You can nest ALDocumentBundles! Just create your bundle in a separate objects block and add it directly into the list of elements. This lets you create a document from multiple templates that you want the user to be able to open and print as one file. Attributes: enabled (optional): make sure to define this if the object is included inside another ALDocumentBundle title: this is displayed on the download screen filename: used to construct the display filename for a pdf version of the bundle Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> DAFile: return a single concatenated PDF of the bundle's attachments as_zip(self, key:str = 'final', refresh:bool = True, title:str = '') -> DAFile: returns a compressed ZIP archive with separate documents for each item. enabled_documents(self, refresh:bool=True) -> List[Any]: return a list of only the \"enabled\" documents in the bundle as_flat_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: get_titles(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[str]: as_pdf_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: as_editable_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: download_list_html(self, key:str='final', format:str='pdf', view:bool=True refresh:bool=True, include_zip:bool = True, view_label=\"View\", view_icon:str=\"eye\", download_label:str=\"Download\", download_icon:str=\"download\", zip_label:str=None, zip_icon:str=\"file-archive\") -> str: returns HTML for a table with download and view buttons, as for a download screen send_button_html(self, key:str='final', show_editable_checkbox:bool = True)->str: send_email(self, to:any=None, key:str='final', editable:bool=False, template:any=None, **kwargs) -> bool: Example of a download screen that uses an ALDocumentBundle: ---progress: 100id: downloadevent: petition_to_change_name_of_adult_downloadquestion: | Your form is ready to download.subquestion: | Thank you ${ user_name_first_new }.

You can add your own template for the individual cover pages for each document, too. Use the stock cover page template as a model. By default, exhibits are labeled sequentially as A, B, and so on. You can supply your own method for labeling each exhibit by defining the auto_labeler attribute of the your_document.exhibits object to be a Python function that accepts an integer and returns a string. The default labeler is just the Docassemble function alpha. If, for example, you wanted to use Roman numerals: mandatory: Truecode: | exhibit_attachment.exhibits.auto_labeler = roman where roman is referring to the Docassemble function.

It displays the signature if and only if i == 'final'. phone_numbers() displays either mobile_number, phone_number, or both if both are present for use in a PDF form with only one space to list phone numbers. contact_methods() displays a list of the contact methods the user provided in the default question library \"contact information\" screen as a formatted string. Specifically, it will display mobile_number, phone_number, email, and other_contact_method. This may be helpful in a formatted letter. age_in_years() returns the individual's age as an integer (whole number), calculated from the individual's birthdate attribute. formatted_age() is like age_in_years() but returns a formatted string with years, months, weeks, and days included when relevant. The cutoff is 2 weeks to display days, 2 years to display months, and anything over 2 years displays only years. name_fields(person_or_business:str = 'person', show_suffix=True) is like address_fields() and is used to display a list of either 3 or 4 fields for a person's name. See Names address_fields() is a wrapper around the address_fields() method of an ALAddress with the same parameters. gender_fields(show_help=False) is like the address_fields() method but displays a list of vetted gender options. Read more about gender questions. initials() is used to return a string with the 1, 2, or 3 initial letters of a person's name. E.g., QKS for Quinten K Steenhuis. language_fields(choices=List[Dict[str, str]]) provides a language selector that sets the .language attribute of the user, together with an other fill-in. This should be the two-letter ISO language code. We recommend defining and passing a dictionary named al_language_user_choices which will also be used by built-in questions triggered from ql_baseline.yml. language_name() will return the language name in English. If there is a system-wide translation words.yml translation file and the user's interface is in that language, the language name will be translated. If the user selected an other option, the other option will be returned. Read-only attributes: The following are all read-only attributes you can use with PDF checkbox fields.

It also has the following additional methods: familiar() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with and joining the last two items familiar_or() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with or joining the last two items short_list(limit:int, truncate_string:str=', et. al.') returns a list that will be cut off at the limit provided.

Relation to the DAList class​ ALPeopleList inherits from Docassemble's DAList class, and retains all methods and attributes of a DAList. Specifically, the language methods, including the pronoun() and related methods, can be used to display the correct pronoun depending on the number and gender of the members of an ALPeopleList. E.g., users.pronoun_possessive() will return her if there is a single user with the gender attribute value \"female\", and their if there are multiple members of the list. These methods can be helpful inside single-language pleading templates but usually should not be used inside the interview itself, as they can make translation challenging. While there are language-specific versions of these methods, they can lead to odd ungrammatical \"fragments\".

Errors combining two branches, trouble merging, trouble combining, resolve merge conflicts, fixing merge conflicts between two branches, branches diverged Sometimes when you start to make a pull request, GitHub will tell you that you have a merge conflict. This means that while you were making changes to your branch, changes were also made to the branch you are trying to merge with and they changed the same lines of code. Git will not decide which bits of code to keep where - you have to decide that. These are unavoidable and a pain to deal with. Everyone runs into them now and again and they are tricky to resolve without introducing bugs. tip Ways to reduce the likelyhood of merge conflicts: If possible, make the goals of your branches small so that you only make a few changes on a branch before making a pull request with it. Merge pull requests in the order they were made. Avoid editing the same sections of code at the same time. If you are working with collaborators, try to make sure you are working on tasks that do not edit the same lines. You can still make your pull request, but GitHub will prohibit merging. There are two ways GitHub might handle merge conflicts: GitHub allows you to 'resolve' the conflict in GitHub itself by editing the files in GitHub. GitHub is unable to help you resolve the issue (it doesn't offer the option). Either way, the most reliable way to deal with this situation is, unfortunately, to redo your changes on top of the new code: Make the pull request as usual, but simply use it as a tool. The changes you made will be highlighted in the file comparison tab. In docassemble create a new Project and pull in the other branch (the one you want to merge with). Using the file comparison as a guide, manually add your changes back.

If you do not select \"Male\" or \"Female\", your form may include an empty checkbox. We intentionally avoid the use of the word other which is dehumanizing and not inclusive. However, some forms do use other, and it may be appropriate to use any option that is not Female or Male to check an Other box, depending on the use and value of requesting gender on the form.

Typically there are three: The final version of a document with a signature. E.g., my_doc['final']. The preview version of a document with no signature. E.g., my_doc['preview']. An addendum of a document contained in the attribute addendum. E.g. my_doc.addendum. There is no limit to the number of keys, but the ALDocumentBundle class expects at least a \"final\" key to exist, and the addendum attribute is required if you desire to use PDF documents with text overflow. It is best practice to use exactly the two keys \"final\" and \"preview\" and the attribute \"addendum\". The \"final\" and \"preview\" documents will normally be the same template, but with logic controlling the display of a particular section, such as the signature. Each form that an interview generates should get its own ALDocument object. The \"addendum\" attribute can be handled in a generic object block. Multiple documents can use the same addendum template, with just the case caption varying. ALDocuments are designed to be used contingently as part of ALDocumentBundle objects. Each ALDocument is considered to be \"enabled\" or \"disabled\" for a particular interview user's session. This allows you to always work with a single object representing all of the possible documents an interview can generate, and use encapsulated logic to trigger individual documents inclusion on the final download screen. Attributes: filename str - name used for output PDF title str - display name for the output PDF enabled bool - if this document should be created. See examples. addendum DAFile | DAFileCollection - (optional) an attachment block overflow_fields ALAddendumField - (optional) ALAddendumFieldDict instance. These values will be used to detect and handle overflow. has_addendum bool - (optional) Defaults to False. Set to True if the document could have overflow, like for a PDF template. Notes: The enabled attribute should always be defined by a code block or the objects block, because by default it is considered fresh on each page load. If your interview logic requires that you directly ask the user whether or not to include a document, you can use a single intermediate variable that is posed to the interview user to work around this limitation.
