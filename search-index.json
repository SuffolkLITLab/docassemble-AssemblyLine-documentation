In designing this feature, we tried to reduce the number of questions a user needs to answer while still asking for specific enough expenses. We don't want to burden the user, but also don't want the user forget to list any significant expenses they would have that could prove financial burden. What expenses you want to initially ask about will depend on your community's needs. For example, if your community lives in northern rural areas, they might have alternative heating needs, like wood or oil, and might not immediately associate those costs with standard \"utilities\". If your community is in a flood plain, you might want to include flood insurance as an option.","s":"Guiding Philosophy","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alincome/expenses","h":"#guiding-philosophy","p":1},{"i":7,"t":"If you want to jump right in, check out a live demo of the ALExpense feature. ALExpense is a class that represents an amount that re-occurs periodically, like a monthly utility bill, or weekly grocery expenses. It has a few attributes: expense.value is the actual amount that is reoccurring. For example, someone's rental insurance might always be $50 each month. expense.times_per_year is the number of times each year that this amount occurs. If someone has to pay their landlord twice a month, times_per_year would be 24. This value can also be fractional if need be; an expense that only needs to be paid once every two years would have a times_per_year of 0.5. expense.source is the source, or name, of the expense. Food expenses could have a source of \"food\". expense.display_name is the name of the source that you want to display to the user. This helps with multi-lingual interviews, where you can show the user the name of the expense, but your interview logic can still refer to a single canonical language name. It also helps add or change additional context to the name that you don't want to write out in your interview logic. For example, expense.source could be \"medical insurance\", but expense.display_name could be \"Medical Insurance (including health, dental, and vision)\". You won't be using ALExpense by itself often though; you'll need a list of expenses from the user, which we'll discuss next.","s":"ALExpense","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alincome/expenses","h":"#alexpense","p":1},{"i":9,"t":"Let's make a short interview that just asks for someone's expenses.

You can customize the options shown to the user by including a definition of an expense_terms variable in your interview. Since the default list is pretty long, we'll make it shorter in this tutorial by copying the below variable definition block: # \"!!omap\" makes these terms ordered: # their order here will be their same order when shown to users.variable name: expense_termsdata: !!omap - rent: \"Rent\" - mortgage: \"Mortgage\" - food: \"Food\" - utilities: \"Utilities\" - clothing: \"Clothing\" - credit cards: \"Credit Card Payments\" - property tax: \"Property Tax (State and Local)\" - other taxes: \"Other taxes and fees related to your home\" - medical: \"Medical costs (including insurance)\" - transportation: \"Transportation costs\" - other: \"Other\" Here is what this question screen will look like: display_name As mentioned in the previous section, expense_terms provides the ALExpense objects in your ALExpenseList with the values for source and for display_name; everything to the left of the colon on each line is source and everything to the right is the longer display_name. For each expense that the user said they have, there will be one question screen, asking for how often they pay for that expense, and how much they pay. If they selected \"other\", they will also be prompted to enter the name of that expense. If you want to change the options for how often they pay the amount, you can define a times_per_year_list, similarly to the expense_terms above. By default, the list contains \"weekly\", \"once every two weeks\", \"twice per month\", \"monthly\", \"once every 3 months\", \"once every 6 months\", and \"yearly\".

When you run its interview, you will be able to pick a Project from your Playground and run the tests in that Project. Pros (Moving) You don't need to put your package on GitHub to run the tests. Running ALKiln on your server lets you loop through your development cycle faster - edit, test, edit, test. You don't have to go through committing your code to GitHub every time. You can see the output online right away, including images and documents. In GitHub, to see all of the output files, you have to download a zip file. The only thing you can see online in GitHub is the summary report. You can more easily limit your tests to a specific set of tests using tag expressions. You can use tags on GitHub too, it just takes more steps. You can more often avoid the red \"x\" that appears next to failing tests on GitHub. The red \"x\" is a useful piece of information, but it can be uncomfortable. Cons (Moving) You'll miss catching some kinds of mistakes. Specifically, you may add a file to your Playground and forget to commit it to GitHub. Your tests will pass in your Playground, but your interview will break when you or others install it from GitHub. If your server reloads while the tests are running, ALKiln may come to a complete stop and you'll have to start the tests all over again. What ALKiln is doing (Moving) When you run Playground tests, they do the following: ALKiln navigates to the file your tests specifies in the Project you picked. For each test (or Scenario), ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to whatever interview you named in the test in the Project you chose. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test. If one of the Steps fails, ALKiln adds that to the test report and tries to take a picture of the page with the problem. It tries to avoid taking pictures of sensitive information. When the tests are done, the output page will show you all the generated reports, images, and files if it can. It will also give you a link to download some of that in a .zip file.","s":"Testing your Playground Projects","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/advanced","h":"#testing-your-playground-projects","p":44},{"i":51,"t":"(Moving) These tests run on GitHub, but they still interact with your server and basically do the same things the Playground tests do, you're just not there to see. Pros (Moving) ALKiln on GitHub will test any changes any team member commits. On your server, you only tests your changes. On GitHub, there are ways to schedule tests to run regularly - every week, every day, or whatever schedule you prefer. If packages you depend on change and break your code, those tests will let you know. If you've forgotten to add a file to the package that an interview depends on (like a missing template file), GitHub will catch that. It installs the file fresh in a new Project, so it only has the files that have been committed properly. You can continue editing any files in your Playground while the GitHub tests run because GitHub creates a whole new Project of its own. When running tests on your server, you must avoid editing the Project that ALKiln is testing. You can configure your GitHub \"action\" to do other things, like create GitHub issues whenever tests fail. If your server reloads during the test run, a few individual tests may fail, but ALKiln will still be able to continue and keep trying to run the rest of the tests. That is because the test code is in running from GitHub, so your reload doesn't stop that process. Cons (Moving) To get these set up, you need to create a docassemble API key, a GitHub token, and make GitHub secrets and you may have to update these in the future. The ALKiln test setup interview helps you do these things, but they can still be confusing. Your tests might be more flaky. That means they may fail for reasons that don't have to do with the interviews. For example, if your tests are running while your server is reloading, ALKiln will keep running, so other tests will still have an opportunity to continue, but individual tests may fail even if your code is correct. Your server can reload for many reasons - updating your config, installing a new package, etc. When tests fail meaninglessly, it slows down your development cycle and sometimes people end up turning off the tests instead of dealing with the complexity. What ALKiln is doing (Moving) Whenever you push (or commit) to GitHub, GitHub will run the tests automatically. You can also trigger them manually. ALKiln goes to the testing account you set up on your server and creates a new Project. If you log into that account, you'll be able to see the new Project in the list of projects. It pulls the relevant branch of your package into the Project. For each test (or Scenario), ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to whatever interview you named in the test. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test. If one of the Steps fails, ALKiln adds that to the test report and tries to take a picture of the page with the problem. It tries to avoid taking pictures of sensitive information. When all the tests are done, ALKiln deletes the Project it created. (Moving) You can see the tests running on your repository's GitHub Actions page. (Moving) At the end, you can see a report and logs right in the workflow's \"job\" page or download a .zip file containing the results of the tests to your computer. That .zip file is what GitHub calls an \"artifact\".","s":"Triggering tests on your server from GitHub","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/advanced","h":"#triggering-tests-on-your-server-from-github","p":44},{"i":53,"t":"(Moving) These tests also run on GitHub, but they create a new docassemble server on GitHub itself and interact with that. They never touch your server. Pros (Moving) This is the most secure of all the methods. The tests don't interact with your server at all. Since the other tests should be running on a test server, not a production server, this shouldn't be a big advantage, but still - the tests have less chance of accidentally exposing the information of other users on that server. All the advantages listed above for the other type of GitHub tests except this improvement: Your tests will generally be less flaky. When a test fails it's more likely to be a problem with your code instead of a problem with the server. That's because the server is isolated on GitHub and no one is going to make that isolated server reload in the middle of the tests. You don't have to set up or update any docassemble API keys or GitHub tokens. Cons (Moving) Tests take about 5 minutes longer since they have to do things like create a docker container and start a server. The GitHub server installs the latest version of docassemble, which might be a different version than the one you use on your server. Allowing authors to install specific versions would take longer to run. We're still considering if this is a feature we should create. We would appreciate feedback. Regardless of that, whatever server GitHub generates probably won't have the exact same setup as your server, so some interviews may not have the same behavior. You have to be more diligent about including all the \"Dependencies\" that your package needs on your interview's \"Packages\" page. If you don't, they won't be installed with your package on this fresh server. What ALKiln is doing (Moving) Like the other GitHub test method, whenever you push (or commit) to GitHub, GitHub will run the tests automatically. You can run these manually as well. ALKiln creates a fresh docker container and docassemble server in GitHub itself. If you have given ALKiln a docassemble config, it uses that config. It tries to get the log for that process and saves it as an artifact on your GitHub action's summary page. It installs the interview as a package directly on the server. ALKiln does the same things we described above, creating the same GitHub artifacts. When all the tests are done, GitHub destroys the server that ALKiln created. tip (Deleted because users never get to it) If you do run both the GitHub-triggered tests and the GitHub isolated server tests, you'll get the fastest results possible. That is, if all goes well, the GitHub-triggered tests might end first and pass. If they don't and the problem is just with your server, the GitHub isolated server tests might complete sooner. If your server is fine, the GitHub-triggered tests will again finish faster. You'll get the fastest results possible. (Moving) GitHub quota limits probably won't be a problem, especially not for public repos.","s":"Testing on a temporary isolated GitHub server","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/advanced","h":"#testing-on-a-temporary-isolated-github-server","p":44},{"i":55,"t":"danger WIP (Work in progress) Welcome to the ALKiln testing framework!

Automated tests need to be updated along with your code. That may not be worth your time for some projects or at some stages in a project. That said, the more complex your project gets the more useful automated tests can be. When you start creating a project, you test it by hand. You open the interview and run it yourself, clicking through every path your user might take. That does not scale as a project grows. Often, there is no time or energy to test all the paths accurately. You end up having to trust that the ones you skip still work. Automated tests make sure you know when your edits break your code. Tests can protect your users from bugs that can: Lead them down the wrong path Give them the wrong output in their generated file Stop them completely with an error Lose their trust in you You can write your simple first test right away if you want. Wait to write more complex tests till your code is more stable. \"More stable\" means that the variables for the section you are testing are mostly staying the same.

Setting them up on your own requires admin access to the repository and the docassemble server and an understanding of the correct files and of GitHub secrets. The ALKiln test setup interview tries to help with that and even people with developer access can do it, but it is complex in its own ways. When GitHub+You™ tests start up, they pull your package code into your docassemble server, just like any other developer. This means that if you test a package with a python module your docassemble server will reload, slowing down access for other people who are using the server. Your tests might be more flaky. That means they may fail for reasons that don't have to do with the interviews. For example, if your tests are running while your server is reloading, ALKiln will keep running, so other tests will still have an opportunity to continue, but individual tests may fail even if your code is correct. Your server can reload for many reasons - updating your config, installing a new package, another GitHub+You™ test pulling in a module when it is setting up, etc. When tests fail meaninglessly, it slows down your development cycle and sometimes people end up turning off the tests instead of dealing with the complexity.

For some people: If you are using a docassemble Docker image created before April 9th, 2023, you will have to do a \"system upgrade\" to update your server to a newer docassemble Docker image. Any version of https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble-os that is older than 1.0.8 uses versions of node that are too old for ALKiln. As of February 11th, 2024, ALKiln is using node version 18.

The items in the table are a snapshot of the user who is filling out the form for that test. Example: And I get to the question id \"has sink\" with this data: | var | value | trigger | | last_haircut_date | today - 730 | last_haircut_date | | wants_virtual_haircut | True | last_haircut_date | | user_name | Beth | user_name | | intro_screen_accepts_terms | True | intro_screen_accepts_terms | The row with | var | value | trigger | is required. How it works: You tell the Story Table Step what question you want to get to. You also make a table of the variables and values the test will need to fill in on its way to that page. Whenever the test gets to a page, it checks your Story Table for any variable names in the table that match a variable name on the page. When the test finds a match, it sets the field to the corresponding value. When the test is done filling in fields on a page, it continues to the next page and repeats until it reaches that question id you gave. As you can see in the example, the order of the items doesn't matter. The test will fill in the fields no matter what order they come in. You will be able to make simple edits to the interview without needing to update your tests. For example, you can move pages around or even move fields to different pages. It also doesn't matter if you include extra items accidentally, though you might want to check the test reports to make sure no necessary fields went unused. You can write a Story Table that goes all the way through your interview, or a Story Table that only goes part way. You can have multiple Story Tables in one Scenario and you can put other Steps between tables.

Checking phrases will be language specific. danger Getting the characters right can be tricky with docassemble. If you get told a phrase is missing, read about a possible reason in the errors section. Then I SHOULD see the phrase \"some phrase\" Then I should NOT see the phrase \"some phrase\" The phrase should be inside double quotation marks and should NOT itself contain regular double quotation marks inside it. That usually isn't a problem with docassemble pages because docassemble transforms our code in ways we don't always expect. See the missing phrase section that talks about special characters.

You can also check all pages past a certain point automatically: Then I check all pages for accessibility issues This is equivalent to running I check the page for accessibility issues on every new page that the test runner sees.

It will also save a copy of all of the page's JSON variables to a file that starts with 'json_for' followed by the question's id. The JSON variables are the same variables that you would see in the docassemble sources tab. caution This step is unable to check values of nested objects.

Examples: (Moving) When I set the variable \"signature_date\" to \"today\" When I set the variable \"birthdate\" to \"today - 500\" When I set the variable \"court_date\" to \"today + 12\" Be careful with today math. If you're testing a \"boundary\" date, you want to pick a date that is well within a boundary to make the test more robust. For example, if you want to test a date that was 10 or fewer days ago, use today - 9 instead of today - 10. At some point your tests might run over midnight. In that situation, if you used 10 the clock would tip into the next day - 11 days from the filled-in date. Your test would fail incorrectly. In fact, your users might have that experience, so design your interview with that in mind. For example, you can tell them the date of the deadline so they too will know about the boundary. You can also use environment variables to set values with the secret variables Step, even if the value doesn't need to be secret. (Moving) The secret variables Step can set variables that have sensitive information. For example, a password. The value of this variable will not appear anywhere in the report or in the console. If there is an error on this page, ALKiln will still avoid taking a picture of the screen. This is a complex Step to use and currently only works with tests running in GitHub (though it's in development for the Playground version). You can use a GitHub \"secret\" to store the value. To learn how to create and add a secret for the test, see the GitHub secrets section.

You can add any additional wait time after tapping the element. When I tap the \"#element-id\" element and go to a new page # Or And I tap the \"#other-element\" element and wait 5 seconds (Moving) You can also tap on HTML elements without navigating. For example, you can tap on collapsible content to show the text inside. When I tap the \"#an_id .al_toggle\" element and stay on the same page You might want to add a wait Step after that to let the contents become visible. For example And I wait .7 seconds. (Moving) Use the tap tab Step to interact with ALToolbox tabs. ALKiln will tap on the tab and then wait until the tab contents are fully visible. When I tap the \"TabGroup-specific_tab_name-tab\" tab Use the HTML id of the tab, but leave out the # symbol (like the example shows).

The baseline PDF must be stored in your \"Sources\" folder along with your tests, and the downloaded PDF should have been downloaded by the above step (Then I download \"download.pdf\") earlier in the same scenario. Then I expect the baseline PDF \"baseline.pdf\" and the new PDF \"download.pdf\" to be the same This will compare all of the text in the baseline PDF with all of the text in the newly downloaded PDF, and then it'll compare the fillable fields of each.

The situations that need this are pretty rare, but here's an example: You navigate to a new page and set a field. Sometimes the test passes, but sometimes the test says an element on this page does not exist. The problem is probably that the page sometimes needs an extra few seconds to load.

It also has two main sections - the failed Scenarios and the Scenarios that passed. Within each of those, every Scenario will have its own section. In the Scenario's section, ALKiln will list the id of each screen where fields were set in the order in which they appeared. Under each screen id will be the names of the variables whose fields were set and the values they were set to. We're still working out some issues here. (Moving) If you used a story table Step, a Scenario might look more like this: ---------------Scenario: I fill in my name---------------screen id: user-name | user.name.first | Maru | | | user.name.last | Plaintiff | | Rows that got set: And I get to the question id \"child information\" with this data: | var | value | trigger | | user.name.first | Maru | | | user.name.last | Plaintiff | | Unused rows: | defendant.name.first | Sam | | | defendant.name.last | Defendant | | Since story table Steps don't care about having extra unused rows, the report lets you know which rows did or did not get used. If rows are listed under \"Unused rows\", ALKiln couldn't find the fields for those variables during the test. Despite that, it was still able to get to the desired question id. You should check that section to make sure all your varibles got used. Rows are listed in alphabetical order. If you have thoughts on pros and cons, we'd love to hear from you. If everything looks right to you there, you can copy and paste the text under \"Rows that got set\" into your test to get rid of the extra rows you've got hanging around.

It will also talk about the security practices ALKiln itself uses. In software development, security can be an intimidating topic. By design, ALKiln tests are unable to do very much, but all software comes with risks. We can mitigate those risks with robust security measures. Over time, we can all build up our security tool chests to: Protect our users' information Protect our security-critical information Protect our servers We want to protect against anything that might expose or modify any important or sensitive data. One of our strongest tools to increase security is the principle of least privilege.","s":"Security","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/security","h":"","p":244},{"i":247,"t":"Follow the principle of least privilege. That means give software (or people) the least access possible to your server and data while still letting them do what they need to do. For example, if someone just needs to fill out an interview, give them the role of \"user\", not \"developer\". If someone needs to develop interviews, give them the role of \"developer\", not \"admin\". It is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and your users. Only give ALKiln the access it needs and no more. Personal data is information about real people, whether that is old information or new information. Security-critical data includes passwords, usernames, API keys, and other credentials.

Limiting ALKiln's access means it: Never has access to actual user information Never has access to your production server's security-critical data like configuration tokens Never has access to your current or old production databases Can never affect the files on your production server First and foremost, avoid installing or running GitHub+You™ and ALKilnInThePlayground™ tests on your production serverbonus.

Instead, use ALKiln's account or a completely separate fake account. Never use a database with real information with your tests, even old information. For example: Never share data between your production server and your testing server. For example, if your production server uses a google spreadsheet to store some user or server data, create a separate google spreadsheet with fake data for your testing server.

The GitHub+You™ tests need to be connected to a docassemble account with the right role (permissions) to work properly. That is the \"developer\" role. Even if you are using another type of test, though, your tests may need an account. For example, you may want a test to sign into an account before going to an interview. If you do need an account to sign in before a test, think of that account as a separate account because you might be able to give that account even less access.

That is called \"freezing\" the version. Then, when you are ready, you can look at what has changed and decide which version you want to update to. By default ALKiln runs your tests with its latest version. This means you have all the latest bug fixes and new features. Some organizations choose to use a version that has code and behavior that is familiar and comfortable to them. ALKiln is actually made of 2 parts. One part is the ALKiln framework, which lets you control the robot that goes to your interview and fills in answers. Another part of ALKiln is its GitHub actions, which manage setting up, starting, and cleaning up the tests. Because of factors out of our control, each of these parts has a different way to set the version. To freeze the framework, you need to use the semantic version number. For example, \"5.8.0\". To freeze the actions, you need to use the 40-character git commit id. Both of those need to point to the sameish code. For example, the semantic version \"5.8.0\" of the ALKiln framework should be paired with the git commit with the id e79eb61cb97603d41375134d505e4fe60de7780d that controls the actions. To freeze your version: Find the semantic version that you want. Look at the \"git blame\" for our package.json. Find the 3rd line down. It should be the line that shows ALKiln's version. To see the previous version, you can tap on this symbol: Go back in history by tapping on that symbol until you find the version you are looking for. For example, 5.8.0. Find the matching commit id. Tap on the commit message for that line. In the address bar of your web browser, look for a 40-character long set of random letters and numbers. The whole address might look something like this: https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln/commit/e79eb61cb97603d41375134d505e4fe60de7780d. In that example url, the commit id (or SHASHA) is e79eb61cb97603d41375134d505e4fe60de7780d. Set both versions. Find your workflow file. Tap to edit the file.

For example, we: Require contributors to make new branches when they edit code Require contributors to make a pull request before new code can be added to the main branch Require administrators to approve a pull request before that code can be merged so that we have a chance to review it Our administrators can get past these restrictions. We keep tight control of who our administrators are.","s":"ALKiln protects its major branches","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/security","h":"#alkiln-branches","p":244},{"i":315,"t":"This is for any packages that: run tests in GitHub ALKiln's action files are very similar to workflow files, like yours.

Using a different server for testing is better in other ways, too. When developers pull packages that have python files onto your docassemble server, it reloads for a while. This can cause your clients' interviews to time out. GitHub+You™ tests do the same and can make for a slower user experience if they are used on a production server.↩ There are other good reasons to avoid using an existing developer's account that are not related to security. For one thing, the tests create Projects and run interviews. It may be confusing for an existing developer to find those in their account. For another thing, if you do use a real developer's account and that developer leaves your organization, tests will start failing. It may take you a while to track down the problem and fix it.↩ GitHub organization secrets can be useful if an organization wants to create a variable that all of its repositories will be able to use and avoid creating that secret in every individual repository.↩ SHA stands for \"secure hash algorithm\". Git has a secure hash algorithm of its own to make an \"id\" for each commit that is 40 characters long. Very broadly, for each commit a repository makes, git uses math to reliably turn the whole history of the package and all its versions, including the newest commit, into 40 letters and numbers. Unlike a branch name, no one can edit a commit SHA because it would break the math. A developer can only delete the commit. Because of this, you can pretty much rely on a commit SHA to always go to either the same code or no code at all. That is, no one can hide sneaky new code there.↩ Technically, the same exact version is usually overkill. As long as the action code and the framework code are aligned, they can point to different versions. This simplification is a lot easier to explain, though.↩","s":"You can report an ALKiln security vulnerability","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/security","h":"#report","p":244},{"i":319,"t":"danger WIP (Work in progress) This page will try to help you figure out what is going wrong when you have errors, warnings, or other problems with your ALKiln tests, whether they are from ALKiln itself or from the libraries ALKiln uses.

For example, maybe you are using an index variable or a generic object incorrectly or maybe you accidentally deleted the block where you were defining the variable. It may be that you have a typo either where you use the variable or where you define the variable. The typo may be in the value instead.

You might have a simple typo or you might have a perfectly normal misunderstanding of how to write variable names and values. You can check your test code for incorrect variable or value names in a few different ways. If you give every question in your interview an id, the report can help show you where the test failed or where ALKiln skipped setting variables. For each test, the report often has a list of question ids. For each question id, the report has a list of variables that ALKiln set on the page that had the error. If the test failed, you can see what question id the test got to. You can also check previous questions to see what variables are missing from each of those pages - what fields ALKiln skipped. It is more annoying, but in most casesexcept you can copy the variable name from your test and search for it in your interview code. You can do the same for values of multiple choice questions. Alternatively, in most casesexcept you can go through the interview manually, but follow this procedure: For every single page (even if you think this page has nothing to do with the problem), click on the </> in the nav bar to see the source of the page. Copy the name of the variable from your test and search for it on the page of the running interview. For multiple choice questions, do the same for the value. Use those values to answer the questions exactly as the test would answer them. Continue doing this till you find the problem. If you are unable to find the name of the variable or value in any other way, our last suggestion is the hardest to do, but most reliable - run the interview manually and inspect each page's HTML to find exact names. This is complex and we are happy to show you how to do this. Here is a refresher: Go to a new page. Click on the </> in the nav bar to see the source of the page. For every field in the page: If you cannot see the variable name or value, like for an object_checkbox field or a field created with code: Open the browser development tools. Examine the DOM of a field to find the encoded name of the variable. Use atob('the encoded name or id') with the encoded name or id to fully decode every part of the variable name. You may have to decode multiple times. From those decoded values, put together the variable name that you need to use. Copy the variable name and use your editor to search for that exact variable name in your test file. The variable name is the fully decoded and reconstructed variable name. In the final variable name, replace x, i, j, etc. with their actual values on that page. If the field is a multiple choice field like radio buttons, do the same for the value and use your editor to search for that exact value in your test file. Make sure it appears along with the correct variable name. For a checkbox field, the value is either True or False. Set the value exactly as the test would have set it.

Possible reasons for missing artifacts for any test: You might have a gherkin syntax error somewhere in your test files. If this was the case, the setup should have completed and the test run should have started, but immediately failed. Find and fix that syntax error. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for GitHub+You™ tests: Your test server was unavailable. If this was the case, your GitHub job logs should show that the test setup failed. Check if the server is running now and run the tests again. Your docassemble developer account credentials were invalid. That is, the API key you created for the docassemble testing account and put in the DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY GitHub input may no longer exist. Maybe the API key got deleted in a docassemble server update. Maybe someone else changed it. You should create a new API key for that testing account and change the value of your DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY secret to the new value. You could also create a new testing account and create a new API key for the new account. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for GitHub Sandbox™ tests: The Docker container or the docassemble server installation is having trouble starting up. If this is the case, your GitHub job logs should show that the docker build step failed. This is a complex problem and takes experience with creating docassemble servers and maybe Docker. You can set the ALKiln SHOW_DOCKER_OUTPUT configuration input to \"true\" to show you more information about what is going on during that setup process. If you have experience with actions and the command line, you might also be able to use the tmate action to explore more about what is going on in your Docker container. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for GitHub+You™ and GitHub Sandbox™ tests: The package manager that installs ALKiln had a problem. This does happen every now and then. If this was the case, your GitHub job logs should show test setup failure. You can check its status, but the problem would have to be happening for a lot of people at once for it to show up.

First, there are reasons even passing tests can be slow, including: Your pages may just be taking a long time to load. This might happen if you are building a large document, uploading a large document, or for other reasons. That can even cause the tests to fail if it takes too long. You can use the \"max seconds\" Step to give them more time. There are some things you can do to speed up some kinds of processes on your server, but that is out of scope for this document. Downloading a lot of documents can take a while. Right now, ALKiln is unable to tell when a document is done downloading, so it gives every document the maximum time possible. By default, that is a full 60 seconds. You can decrease that time with the \"max seconds\" Step, but that time might be too short for the documents to download. You can experiment a bit. You can also be tricky with the \"max seconds\" Step, though, and increase and decrease the value at appropriate times to improve both speed and downloading. If your server reloads a lot during GitHub+You™ tests, it will take longer for tests to finish because the tests try to wait for the server to be available to avoid \"flaky\" tests. Your server can reload for many reasons. For example, saving your config file, saving a python module, or pulling a package that uses a python module can all cause your server to reload. This might even cause your tests to fail. There are also some different reasons that tests get slower when they fail, including: Each failing test gets re-run once, so that can double the amount of time that tests take. Currently, there is no way to choose whether to re-run tests or not. When a Story Table is trying to reach a target page and gets stuck somewhere, it will wait the maximum seconds allowed for a page load (which you can change) to let the interview continue to the next page. By default, that is 30 seconds.

You just have to re-run those tests. A slow-loading interview page might make ALKiln think your server is unavailable. That can happen for different reasons. For example, a large document might be taking a long time to load. You might be able to avoid this failure by increasing the maximum wait time with the \"max seconds\" Step. That can make tests slower. You can be tricky about it, though. If you just increase that value for one Step and then reduce it again, that can avoid slowing down your tests too much. Tapping on an element might show content and move other elements around. ALKiln might fail to click on the elements that are moving. You can use the \"wait\" Step to give elements more time to finish moving. Third-party services, like GitHub or package managers, that the tests rely on do have problems every now and then. You just have to re-run those tests. An interview page rendering slowly can hide a field that ALKiln is trying to fill in. If we find that there is a particular type of field that is particularly slow to load, we can slow down ALKiln for that type of field, but that is the most ALKiln can do.

On our project we benefited from a lot of volunteers and the ability to split roles more evenly. Think about finding people to play the following roles: Project manager Researcher and content author Subject matter expert and liaison to subject matter expert Template cleanup and adding labeled fields (in Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word) Python coder Frontend / HTML / CSS / JavaScript coders Docassemble developer Plain language reviewer and editor Tester We found the most success in asking short-term volunteers to help with testing, cleaning up and adding labeled fields to templates, and Python and frontend coding (for discrete tasks that didn't demand too much familiarity with our whole code base). Subject matter experts, similarly, did not require a long-term commitment to the project, but did require some orientation to understand what an interactive legal application can and should do. Longer-term members of our team fit more naturally into other roles. People often changed roles and overlapped them over the time that they volunteered. For example: almost all of our members did some Docassemble development as they gained comfort and familiarity as the project went on. Project management is a learned skill that fit well with people who were outgoing and organized, and also did not demand extensive coding experience. We found it necessary to have a project manager role to make sure content actually got out the door. Otherwise, apps could spend too much time in the refining stage. The urgency of the pandemic helped us center delivering working apps as a goal. While not an explicit role in the project, we also found it important to share our work in progress with community groups and stakeholder groups early to gain important insights about features and how our project should be designed. Often, this was in the form of a demo with an explicit ask for feedback, so at the stage a bit beyond the useful prototype stage.","s":"Roles","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/assembly_line_steps/roles","h":"","p":379},{"i":383,"t":"Spend some time mapping out the process.

For an access to justice project (non-commercial) you will want to build relationships directly with your regional legal help website, courts, cities, and governmental partners to get direct links to your landing page on their relevant self-help guides. Consider direct outreach to potential repeat users of your app. For a tool focused on domestic violence, building an ongoing relationship with victims advocates in the police department, legal aid, and domestic violence shelters, for example, will lead to many more users of your app than any approach to reaching consumers directly. Hopefully, most of your consumers will be one-time users. Advocates will use it again and again. This direct outreach should be sustained over time. You can monitor analytics and referrals to understand where your users are coming from and where to concentrate your outreach.

You can generate a first draft for a more complex test with the help of the ALKiln Story Table Step generator. If your interview is using generic objects or index variables, you must include special HTML in your interview. Every time you change or add a required field variable, you must update the tests that need that variable. You write and edit .feature test files in your package's Sources folder. You can check the syntax of your test file by using an editor like the editor at AssertThat. If you are using GitHub+You™ or GitHub Sandbox™ tests, those tests will run when anyone commits to GitHub. By default, each Step or page must be completed in at most 30 seconds. You can change that with the \"max seconds\" Step. ALKiln creates test reports and pictures. For example, ALKiln saves pictures and the HTML of pages that caused errors. In GitHub, those files are in the zip file in your workflow's artifact section. There are some field types that ALKiln cannot yet handle, including some object-type fields. The tests use the gherkin language and syntax. Here is an example of a more complex test for a quick refresher on some of ALKiln's features: @childrenFeature: I have children@fast @child_benefitsScenario: child has benefits Given I start the interview at \"some_file_name.yml\" And I get to the question id \"benefits\" with this data: | var | value | | children.there_are_any | True | | children.target_number | 2 | | children[0].name.first | Cashmere | | children[0].name.last | Davis | | children[1].name.first | Casey | | children[1].name.last | Davis | When I set the var \"benefits['SSI']\" to \"True\" And I tap to continue Then the question id should be \"download\" And I download \"some_motion.pdf\"","s":"Quick refresher","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/writing","h":"#refresh","p":494},{"i":501,"t":"Most of the code in test files is code for ALKiln Steps.

And is one of the keywords that can start a Step I set the variable \"___\" to \"___\" is an ALKiln command with blanks that you need to fill in likes_bears and True are the information you put in the blanks so that the ALKiln robot knows what answer to give to a question That command description can also be written as I set the variable \"<variable name>\" to \"<value>\". This tells you what information you should put in each of these blanks. In this case there are two blank spaces you should fill. In the first blank, you should put the name of the variable that the field will set. In the second blank, you should put the value that you want the variable to have. Each of your tests - a Scenario or a Scenario Outline - usually contains many Steps. Any Step can be used as many times as you want anywhere in a test.

Each of them must be the name of an environment variable that you have already added to your workflow file. The <username env var> variable should contain the username of a dedicated account on your docassemble server. The <password env var> variable should contain the password of that account. Example Step: Given I sign in with the email \"ALKILN_USER_EMAIL\" and the password \"ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD\" \"ALKILN_USER_EMAIL\" and \"ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD\" are just examples of environment variable names.

Sensitive information You must use GitHub secrets to set the environment variables in order to keep the information secure. You should also use a separate account for signing in like this. Never use a real person's account or information. ALKiln does avoid taking pictures or downloading the HTML for this Step, even when the test has an error on that page, so that information is still protected.

The Step format: Given the maximum seconds for each Step is <number> The blank to fill in is <number> - the number of seconds to allow a Step to run, or a page to be filled, before the test fails. Example: Given the maximum seconds for each Step is 200 You can set the max seconds as your first Step to give a slow-loading interview more time to load. If you are worried about increasing the time too much, you can immediately decrease the time after the interview loads. For example: Given the maximum seconds for each Step is 200 And I start the interview at \"favorite_bears.yml\" And the maximum seconds for each Step is 30 You can also increase this setting before you try to download a large file. ALKiln spends twice the value of this setting to download a file. You can read more about the timing in the \"download\" Step. You can use this Step to change the maximum seconds setting at any time in your test. Increasing the maximum time can have down-sides. Some kinds of failures take the maximum amount of time possible. Since each failed test is re-run, those failing tests will take twice the amount of time that you set for your maximum Step time.

For example, if text is too small or if contrast between the text and its background is too low. If ALKiln found problems, the test will fail at the end. ALKiln uses aXe-core to check for problems.

It is the Step many of our authors work with the most. In our opinion, it is the most flexible way to fill in fields in your forms, unlike the linear \"I set\" Step. This makes a test easier to maintain. The Story Table Step is made of a sentence followed by a table. The data in the table is a snapshot of the user who is filling out the form. Each table row describes one fact about the user - one variable in the interview. It has this format: And I get to the question id \"<target question id>\" with this data: | var | value | | <variable name> | <value to set> | | <variable name> | <value to set> | As you can see, there are three types of blanks you need to fill in for this Step: <target question id> is the idid of the question block where you want ALKiln to stop using this table. <variable name> is the name of an interview variable for a form field. Each table row needs one of these in the first column. <value to set> is the value to set for this row's variable name. The table must include all the variables and values necessary to get a user from the current page to the page with the given question id. The table must have two columns with the headings var and value. An example table: And I get to the question id \"brought scissors\" with this data: | var | value | | last_haircut_date | today - 730 | | wants_virtual_haircut | True | | user_name | Jaime | | intro_screen_accepts_terms | True | This Step is flexible, which makes the test easier to maintain. The order of the rows is unimportant. That means you can edit the order of your pages or move fields to different pages without worrying about breaking the test. .there_is_another Avoid using .there_is_another in your Story Table. Read about using .target_number instead. Things to note You can use the Story Table generator to generate a first draft of a full test file. If your interview uses generic objects (x) or index variables (i, j, k, etc), you must have special HTML in your interview to set the values of variables. Right now, Story Tables are unable to use environment variables to fill in answers, so you cannot use them to set sensitive information like passwords. Unused rows The Story Table does not care about extra rows that never get used. This can make Story Tables easier to write, but it also means that the tests will technically \"pass\" even if variables that should get set are never filled in. That can be a sign that a question that the user should have seen got skipped or that there is a typo or mistake in the test. Because of this, the ALKiln report shows a list of unused rows for each table. You can check the report of passing tests to make sure none of the important rows got skipped. How this works, for the curious folks out there On each interview page, ALKiln: Checks if the page has the <target question id> you gave it at the start If the page does have the <target question id> it stops the Step Otherwise, it looks at each <variable name> in the var column to see if it can find that name in any fields For each <variable name> it finds, it tries to answer the field using the matching <value to set> On pages with show if fields, it waits to see if a new field appears If one does appear, it looks through each <variable name> again It sets any value it can and repeats this process When no new fields get revealed, ALKiln tries to continue to the next page If it is unable to continue it logs an error and stops Otherwise, it repeats the above ALKiln sets a table variable every time it finds that variable on any page, no matter how many times that variable appears in your interview.","s":"The Story Table Step","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/writing","h":"#story-table","p":494},{"i":521,"t":"Use the \"I set\" Step to fill in one value on one page. If your interview uses generic objects (x) or index variables (i, j, k, etc), you must have special HTML in your interview to set the values of variables. The format of the Step: And I set the variable \"<variable name>\" to \"<value>\" There are two types of blanks you need to fill for this Step. The first set of quotes in this Step contain the name of the variable you need to set. The second set of quotes contain the value you want to set. This is the same as the Story Table's's var column and value column. This Step is \"linear\". That is, unlike Story Table rows, these \"linear\" variable-setting Steps have to be in the correct order and you must make sure your test has reached the exact page that has the field. Otherwise your test will fail.

Even though the name has \"GitHub\" and \"secret\" in it, it can also use environment variables. It is still the only way to use sensitive information in your tests. To do that, you can use environment variables with GitHub secrets. If your interview uses generic objects (x) or index variables (i, j, k, etc), you must have special HTML in your interview to set the values of variables. The format of the Step: And I set the variable \"<variable name>\" to the GitHub secret \"<environment variable name>\" Here, <variable name> is the name of the variable you want to set and <environment variable name> is the name of the environment variable that has the value. Example: I set the variable \"user1_account_password\" to the GitHub secret \"ALKILN_USER1_PASSWORD\" A lot of authors use this Step to set answers with sensitive information, like an account number. This is because ALKiln is extra careful with the security of these values. Since workflow environment variables might hold sensitive information, ALKiln avoids taking pictures or downloading the HTML of pages that use environment variables, even when the test has an error on that page. ALKiln avoids printing the value of an environment variable anywhere in the report or in the console log. Not for sign in This Step is unable to sign into your docassemble server.

For security, we strongly recommend you put this information into a GitHub secret like DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY above. If you have special configuration settings on your own server, you can use input to include them and make this new fresh server more like your production server. The default is the default config that docassemble itself uses. SHOW_DOCKER_OUTPUT you can give this the values \"true\" or \"false\". When you set it to \"true\", you will see more output when ALKiln creates the docker container and installs docassemble there.

(You do that in your workflow file.) What is a variable? A \"variable\" is a name with a value. That name, a \"variable name\", lets the rest of the program ask for that value when needed.name Like calling a kid in for dinner. That is close enough for what we need right now.vars What are environment variables? Environment variables are variables that are available to the whole system - the whole environment the programs are working in. Like the town where that kid lives and where their house is. That means every test in your test suite can use that variable. You can call that kid in for dinner no matter where in the city they are. Because environment variables are so global, we recommend you start all your environment variable names with \"ALKILN_\" so they have less chance to interfere with your system's other environment variables. If you are going to broadcast your message across the town, every kid should have a unique name so everyone knows who you are yelling at. In ALKilnInThePlayground™ tests on your server, you put these values in your config file under a key you can add called alkiln. For example: alkiln: ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE: \"small_bear\" ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE is the name of the environment variable. \"small_bear\" is the value of the environment variable. All the interviews on your server can see these config values, including the interview that runs your ALKilnInThePlayground™ tests, so you are actually setting these values for all the tests that you run on your server with ALKilnInThePlayground™ tests. In GitHub, you can make GitHub workflow environment variables by putting them in the env key in your workflow file: # other codeenv: ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE: \"small_bear\"job: # other code ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE is the name of the environment variable. \"small_bear\" is the value of the environment variable. In GitHub, there are different places to put env, so don't worry if you see them in other places in other people's files. You can combine environment variables with GitHub secrets to set sensitive information in your tests. Also, a GitHub organization can combine environment variables with GitHub secrets to get a value to all the test suites in all the organization's repositories. Since workflow environment variables might hold sensitive information, ALKiln avoids taking pictures or downloading the HTML of pages that use environment variables, even when the test has an error on that page. ALKiln avoids printing the value of an environment variable anywhere in the report or in the console log.","s":"Environment variables","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alkiln/writing","h":"#env-vars","p":494},{"i":627,"t":"This is for: owners of GitHub repositories or organizations Shhh, don't tell anyone else - a secret is a value GitHub encrypts for you. Not even you can see a secret in GitHub after you create it. In fact, GitHub redacts those values from your workflow logs. You can make secrets for individual GitHub repositories or you can make secrets for your whole GitHub organization. Once you have made the secrets, you might use them in combination with GitHub environment variables and for multiple reasons: Secrets are useful for creating values with sensitive information since no one can see those values. For example, with the \"sign in\" Step. Here is one example of using a secret in a workflow file: # other codeenv: ALKILN_USER_EMAIL: \"${{ secrets.ALKILN_USER_EMAIL }}\" ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD: \"${{ secrets.ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD }}\"job: # other code Remember to create a separate account for that \"user\". GitHub secrets are useful for sharing values between GitHub organization repositories. All the repositories of a GitHub organization can see its secrets, so you can affect all of those repositories at once from one location. Example situation For example, suppose Mo'nique has a GitHub organization named PolarisLaw. That organization has several repositories. Every test in every repository uses the value \"small_bear\" as an answer to a question. Next month, though, the firm might need to change that value to \"large_bear\". Mo'nique would have to edit that value in every test in every repository. Instead, she makes a GitHub secret in the PolarisLaw account called ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE and sets it to small_bear. Then she uses it in an environment variable she puts in all the workflow files in all the repositories. env: ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE: \"${{ secrets.ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE }}\" She can then use that environment variable in her tests: I set the variable \"bear_size\" to the GitHub secret \"ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE\" Next month, if PolarisLaw needs to change that value, Mo'nique can just edit the value of that secret and change it to large_bear. All the tests will use the new value without her changing anything else. Why not create secrets on your server for ALKilnInThePlayground™ tests? On your server all config values are already secret because only authorized people can see them, so they are just like any other environment variable. And all of your server's interviews can see and share those config values already.

They include: the question help button the glossary terms feature the under area the field hint modifier that adds placeholder text the field help modifier the option help modifier Through expert feedback, we have determined that the question help button should never be used. The placement of the button and the use of a separate mode for help text can be confusing. Help may also come \"too late\" with this feature, after a user has already completed answering the questions on screen. We also discourage use of the hint modifier that adds placeholder text to a field. Multiple references discourage this feature. The under feature can be a helpful place to add additional context to a screen, although the field-specific note feature may be more consistent with user expectations across multiple questions. The glossary terms feature should be used cautiously, perhaps with additional CSS to make it more distinctive. The risk with this feature is distracting or confusing users. The field and option help modifiers are both relatively clear and simple to use for field-specific hints and to explain choices that may otherwise not be clear.

Forward thinking courts have readability targets of 6th grade. But because people don't just read forms--they answer questions and follow instructions--readability isn't a very good measure of form complexity, at least not on its own: Forms use lots of short text (like: Address, Name, and so on), while readability scores are designed to evaluate long narratives. Litigants answer questions and follow instructions on forms as well as reading words. Answers can require getting information from a third party, finding a specific piece of paper (like an ID card), doing math, or making a decision. Answers can be very sensitive, either because they are about private information, like a Social Security Number, or because they evoke a traumatic response, like details of an assault. Answers come in different formats, too. The difference between checking a box and writing out a long answer is significant. Complexity and sensitivity can't always be avoided. For example: a complaint asking for protection from abuse needs to disclose some information about the abuse. But forms should never impose a burden on the litigant that doesn't have a matching benefit.","s":"Why readability scores aren't good enough","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/complexity/complexity","h":"#why-readability-scores-arent-good-enough","p":767},{"i":779,"t":"We built the RateMyPDF score by combining feedback from: Form automators Form authors Legal aid experts Court staff And our own in-house experience from building the Document Assembly Line.

If you prefer more control over building the theme, you can create a custom theme from the bootstrap source code. The Bootstrap documentation covers the details of theming if you want to take this approach. Create a new custom.scss file anywhere on your computer to contain the SASS/CSS styles for your branding. Detailed instructions on what this file can contain are in the Bootstrap documentation. You can use a color theme generator like Huemint.com to make sure that you have a consistent set of all 9 Bootstrap variables. When you use the color theme generator, at the bottom of the page, you will see a small snippet of code that you can copy into the customs.scss file. For example, your new custom.scss might look like this: // Custom.scss// Option A: Include all of Bootstrap// Include any default variable overrides here (though functions won't be available)$white: #ffffff;$theme-colors: ( \"light\": #d8e2a5, \"dark\": #1b1b1b, \"primary\": #25dec6, \"secondary\": #375b5a, \"info\": #d74d72, \"success\": #0cb545, \"warning\": #f4ca0b, \"danger\": #fa043c,);// Note: we placed our custom.scss file in the bootstrap path for simplicity,// so we use a different path than in the bootstrap documentation// @import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";@import \"bootstrap\";// Then add additional custom code here Once you have written your custom.scss file, you can use the ALDashboard (which you can install on your docassemble server) to compile a custom Bootstrap theme. If you are associated with the Suffolk LIT Lab and have an account on the Suffolk Development server, you can visit a live version of the tool to try it out. At the end of the tool, you can view what all of the different bootstrap components will look like with your theme. If you want to change any of the colors, you can go back and edit your \"custom.scss\" file and regenerate the bootstrap theme. Once you like the colors you've chosen, download the compiled file, and then add it a docassemble project, in the static folder. You can then reference your new file by adding a bootstrap theme feature to your interview: features: bootstrap theme: my_bootstrap_theme.css Running node and npm to build a Bootstrap config (optional)​ If you don't have access to a docassemble server yourself, you can also compile a bootstrap theme from source using node and npm. Use a computer with a current version of Node. The instructions on this page assume you are using an Ubuntu Linux computer with Node installed, but they should be the same on any workstation. They were tested on a machine running Windows 11 with Ubuntu running under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It also assumes that you have VS Code installed, but you can use any text editor of your choice. First, download the Bootstrap source, and install its dependencies.

Once you have a .woff file, upload it to the /static folder of a Docassemble playground. Add an @font-face directive to your bootstrap.css file (or a separate CSS file that you reference in the features block of your interview) You cannot include Mako tags in your CSS file, so in order to use the new font face, you should add it to a Docassemble package and then install the package on your server. Example: @font-face { font-family: 'my_font'; src: url('/packagestatic/docassemble.MyTheme/my_font.woff2') format('woff2'), url('/packagestatic/docassemble.MyTheme/my_font.woff') format('woff'); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;} In the example above, MyTheme is a Docassemble package that is installed server-wide. my_font is both the name of a web font and the name of the WOFF file.","s":"Using custom fonts in the frontend","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/customization/overview","h":"#using-custom-fonts-in-the-frontend","p":789},{"i":805,"t":"If you would like to use a font other than the Microsoft fonts popular in the late 1990s-2000 era (Arial, Times New Roman, Courier) then you will need to install the fonts on your Docassemble server.

Handling court hierarchies is a complicated task, and something that the AssemblyLine can't do for you. You'll need to make your own way to let users select what court they want to file in depending on your jurisdiction. See our documentation for al_courts for some possible ideas. You should be able to run the interview now. If this is the first time you're running the interview on the server, you will be asked to log in to eFileIL. If you don't yet have an account, you should be able to make a new pro-se user account with eFileIL by following the links to make a new account on the page. Once you've logged in on the server, subsequent runs of the interview won't ask you to log in, until the eFileIL token expires and you have to log in again, in about 1-2 hours. The next page will ask if you want to search by party name or by case number. For now, let's search by case number. If you select \"case number\", and then enter the case number \"2022SC9\", you should find a case, John Smith vs. Bob Doe, a small claims case. info This case search worked at the time of writing (February 28th, 2023). However, courts have removed older cases from their staging servers before, and it is possible that this search won't work in the future. You can try searching common names like \"John Brown\" or \"John Smith\", or you could ask a court official if they are able to provide you with some testing case numbers from their staging server. We recommend that you build a working relationship with your local courts so they can help you with details like this. You can also go back and search by \"Party name\" instead. You can enter the name \"John Smith\", press continue, and wait. Searching by party name takes longer on eFileIL's server, especially on the staging server, you might have to wait around 30 seconds. Once the search completes, you will see that there are many cases involving John Smith. For speed purposes, the EFSP library only gets information about the first 8, and let's you click the next button to see the next 8. If you select the John Smith vs. Bob Doe case, you then see the last page in the interview YAML; show_all_info. This page shows all of the information that you, the interview author, can use from the case_search.found_case, the variable for the found case. The details and case_details attributes aren't stable APIs, but you might find the following attributes useful: court_id, the court that this case came from. Some courts have sub-courts that handle specific case types, so even though you searched for cases in the \"adams\" court, you should use this value for the rest of the interview. participants, an ALPeopleList object that has all of the participants in the case on both sides. each participant has a party_type and party_type_name, i.e. participants[0].party_type_name might be \"Plaintiff/Petitioner\". These values are Tyler e-filing codes that are set by the court. attorneys is a dictionary that contains any attorneys that are a part of the case. efile_case_type is the Tyler e-filing code for the type of case. This is useful if your interview is only relevant for certain case types. If users don't or can't fill out your form for their case, you can send users to a page that says they don't need this form and why. docket_number has the case number of the court. \"Docket number\" is the term that Massachusetts uses for a unique number assigned to each case by the court. You might know it as \"case number\".

Including the add_existing_users line triggers code in the EFSPIntegration package that asks the user which participant they are in the case, and then fills in users and other_parties based on that information. If your form generally deals with party types other than \"defendant\" and \"plaintiff\", you will likely want to look at the is_defendant_filters and is_plaintiff_filters variables in docassemble-EFSPIntegration:case_search.yml which you can override to sort participants by their codes from a case into your typical ALPeopleLists in your form.","s":"Using case search data in your Assembly Line interview","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/efiling/case_search","h":"#using-case-search-data-in-your-assembly-line-interview","p":812},{"i":824,"t":"Read the guidance below before contributing to our documentation page.

To keep it simple, the interview will only file one type of case; this lets us hardcode a few pieces of information in our interview. We'll first need to find the right \"codes\" for our interview. Tyler's E-filing system defines specific codes for many different parts of the filing process, include the over-arching category of the case, the more specific case type, and even things like whether or not the filed document should be confidential or not. To find the right codes, navigate through the URLs provided by visiting https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes. Firefox will display clickable links that you can use to browse the different codes. For example, say we want to write an Adoption interview. The codes in Illinois are split by courts, so to see the case categories available to one particular court, say Adams, we can go to https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/categories, and scroll through the responses until we find the \"Adoption\" entry, code 7306. We would then see the case types for Adoption cases in adams at https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/case_types?category_id=7306&timing=Initial, which is 25361. The endpoints should say when they need parameters, like we provided with category_id=7306&timing=Initial above. We are currently working on a better interface for finding and handling these codes at runtime based on our experiences in Illinois and Massachusetts. Stay tuned. For this guide, we'll stick with a single court, to make things simple to understand. We'll use the following codes: variable name purpose example value example meaning efile_case_category the over arching category of the case \"7306\" Adoption efile_case_type the specific type of case \"25361\" Adoption efile_case_subtype optional, if there needs to be more specific case types N/A N/A party_type what the role of an individual or party is in the case \"7067\" or \"20640\" Adoptive parent or child filing_type what the filing actually is, usually the name of the document \"29730\" Application document_type If the document is confidential or not \"5766\" Non-confidential filing_component If this is the lead document or if it's an attachment \"332\" Lead document","s":"Get the information needed to file","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/efiling/docassemble","h":"#get-the-information-needed-to-file","p":863},{"i":876,"t":"Now that we have all of the codes that we want, we need to define the right variables, setting their values to the codes we found above.

If you need to check the value of multiple variables in one if statement, you need to use the more complex js show if. When you use js show if, you need to use a JavaScript expression that uses the function val() at least once. val() is a JavaScript function that returns the value of a variable name that is visible on screen. It takes the name of the Docassemble variable in quotes as its only parameter. Here is a small example of a js show if expression: ---id: Tell me more about Respondentquestion: | Tell me more about the ${ other_parties[0] }.fields: - Is ${ other_parties[0] } employed?: other_parties[0].is_employed datatype: yesnoradio - Is ${ other_parties[0] } a parent of your child?: other_parties[0].joint_parent datatype: yesnoradio - ${ other_parties[0] }'s monthly income: other_parties[0].income datatype: currency js show if: | val(\"other_parties[0].is_employed\") && val(\"other_parties[0].joint_parent\") Check the js show if documentation to learn how to use different combinations of values in a js show if expression. The key is that you'll use ordinary JavaScript keywords to do any comparisons.

It contains questions about people's names, addresses, birthdates, gender and pronouns, and party roles. You can always write your own version of a question in the library. Docassemble reads your YAML file from top to bottom, so if you add your question that defines the same variables after the include block, Docassemble will always use your version. You maybe shouldn't write your own version. The question library questions are tested by real users. Some customization is to be expected, but be sure you have a clear reason for your choice. Question library questions don't appear in your own YAML file. But you can copy them when your interview is running. Here's how: In the top navigation bar, click the \"source\" button (it looks like </>). Scroll down until you see the question text. Copy it into your own YAML file. Near the other question blocks in your interview is the best place. Add the --- separator at the beginning of the block you copy. Make the changes that you want. About generic object The generic object modifier is a special way to make one question work for many different objects, like people or lists of people. When you customize a question from the question library, you may want to make it specific to one variable in your interview, rather than replace the generic version of the question for any person. To make it specific: Remove the generic object line. Replace x with your variable name. Customize the question and subquestion as needed. For example, suppose your interview asks for a list of guardians. There is no special question about guardians in the question library, so your interview will use the generic object version of the question, which looks like this: ---id: name of the first personsets: - x[0].name.first - x[0].name.last - x[0].name.middle - x[0].name.suffixgeneric object: ALPeopleListquestion: | % if hasattr(x, 'ask_number') and x.ask_number and x.target_number == 1: Name of ${ noun_plural(x.object_name(),1) } % else: Name of your first ${ noun_plural(x.object_name(),1) } % endiffields: - code: | x[0].name_fields() Here is a version made specific to guardians: ---id: name of the first personsets: - guardians[0].name.first - guardians[0].name.last - guardians[0].name.middle - guardians[0].name.suffixquestion: | What is the name of the first person you want to name as guardian?fields: - code: | guardians[0].name_fields() A specific version of a question is always used before the generic object version. About the variable i Just like generic object works for any object, the variable i (and other index variables) lets you write a question for any item in a list. Using a specific number (typically, just the first, or 0th item is treated specially) overrides the one that uses the letter i.","s":"Understanding the question library","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/customizing_interview","h":"#understanding-the-question-library","p":879},{"i":914,"t":"Every screen in Docassemble is asked for a reason, and you can always find out why.

The metadata can include things like a case number, the names of parties, and codes that tell a clerk what kind of filing is being delivered. E-filing replaces delivering documents to the court by hand, mail, or courier. Traditionally, e-filing requires visiting a dedicated web page, creating an account, converting documents into PDF format, and then inputting a lot of confusing information, such as document type, filing codes, and court codes. The LIT Lab's primary tool is code that guided interview authors can incorporate to add a simple one-click e-file button into an existing guided interview. The interview author can pre-select or help the litigant select the proper codes. This removes the most challenging part of traditional e-filing. If the litigant qualifies for a fee waiver, they may not even be required to create an account. We have also created a very simple e-filing \"portal\" that works much like traditional e-filing websites. This is not a product we expect end-users to interact with just yet. There are many competing systems of e-filing, but often there is a monopoly vendor within a given jurisdiction. Often, the vendor may have a program that allows third-parties to deliver documents to the vendor. Then, the vendor takes care of delivering the document the rest of the way to the court's docket. If you think of the e-filing vendor as a corporate mail room, then third-party vendors like the Suffolk LIT Lab are the equivalent of UPS or FedEx. We just get the document to the building. The e-filing vendor handles getting it to the right desk. From a court clerk's point of view, the filing looks just like a filing uploaded through the vendor's first-party system.","s":"What is e-filing?","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/efiling/overview","h":"#what-is-e-filing","p":934},{"i":941,"t":"The LIT Lab is a certified EFSP, or Electronic Filing Service Provider, for the Tyler Technologies system.

ALDocumentBundle objects can be nested to allow you to group multiple individual template files into one document that the user can download. Both ALDocument and ALDocumentBundle objects can be either enabled or not.

There are usually exactly two keys in the dictionary: preview and final, with the only difference being the presence or absence of a signature. Conditional logic inside the template or attachment block can be used to show or hide the signature depending on the value of the key so that the template does not need to be created twice. The signature_if_final method of an ALIndividual was created to simplify this common use case. Here's how to use an ALDocument: Create ALDocument objects in an objects block. Set any required attributes, like enabled, in the object block or in a separate code block. If you set enabled=True in the object block, your document will always be enabled. Define the key of the ALDocument in an attachment block using the variable name modifier. Usually, use one attachment block and define the variable name like this: variable name: some_al_document[i]. Optionally, reference the ALDocument inside an ALDocumentBundle. Example: ---objects: - letter: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"ssa_letter\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False)---attachment: - pdf template file: ssa_letter.pdf variable name: letter[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) }","s":"ALDocument class","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/aldocument","h":"#aldocument-class","p":964},{"i":970,"t":"If other variables in your interview determine if your document is enabled, you should define the enabled attribute in a code block, like this: ---objects: - main_document: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"main_document\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False) - insurance_rider: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"rider\", has_addendum=False)---attachments: - pdf template file: main_document.pdf variable name: main_document[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } - pdf template file: rider.pdf variable name: rider[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) }---code: | if total_cost > 1000: insurance_rider.enabled = True else: insurance_rider.enabled = False # or more concise but slightly harder to read: # insurance_rider.enabled = total_cost > 1000 In the example above, the insurance_rider document is only included in any bundles if the total cost of the project is over $1,000. Note that the enabled value is global for the interview session. If you want to use different logic in different bundles, you can easily create a separate ALDocument that references the same template file and attachment block. Attributes: filename: the display filename used for the document when it is downloaded title: the title shown on the download screen enabled: whether the document should be \"turned on\" when it is referenced in an ALDocumentBundle addendum: points to a variable representing an attachment block with a formatted addendum.

Here's how to use an ALDocumentBundle: Create the ALDocumentBundle in an objects block. Add each ALDocument or nested ALDocumentBundle that your interview will sometimes produce to the bundle. Because the list is usually known in advance, it's common to include this in the object definition. Use the as_pdf() method on your preview screen to display a preview of the output without any signature. Use the download_list_html() and send_button_html() methods on your download screen. You can have as many or as few bundles as you would like. The Assembly Line convention is to use the following two bundles: al_user_bundle which should include a next steps document with instructions for your user al_court_bundle which leaves out the instructions and should have every document that you want the clerk to receive Stick with this convention if you expect to integrate with E-filing. Example: ---objects: - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[ssa_next_steps, letter]) - al_court_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[letter]) note You can nest ALDocumentBundles! Just create your bundle in a separate objects block and add it directly into the list of elements. This lets you create a document from multiple templates that you want the user to be able to open and print as one file. Attributes: enabled (optional): define this if the bundle is included inside another ALDocumentBundle. If other variables in your interview determine if it's enabled, you should define the attribute in a code block, like in this earlier example title: this is displayed on the download screen filename: used to construct the display filename for a pdf version of the bundle Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> DAFile: return a single concatenated PDF of the bundle's attachments as_zip(self, key:str = 'final', refresh:bool = True, title:str = '') -> DAFile: returns a compressed ZIP archive with separate documents for each item. enabled_documents(self, refresh:bool=True) -> List[Any]: return a list of only the \"enabled\" documents in the bundle as_flat_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: get_titles(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[str]: as_pdf_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: as_editable_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: download_list_html(self, key:str='final', format:str='pdf', view:bool=True refresh:bool=True, include_zip:bool = True, view_label=\"View\", view_icon:str=\"eye\", download_label:str=\"Download\", download_icon:str=\"download\", zip_label:str=None, zip_icon:str=\"file-archive\") -> str: returns HTML for a table with download and view buttons, as for a download screen send_button_html(self, key:str='final', show_editable_checkbox:bool = True)->str: send_email(self, to:any=None, key:str='final', editable:bool=False, template:any=None, **kwargs) -> bool: Example of a download screen that uses an ALDocumentBundle: ---progress: 100id: downloadevent: petition_to_change_name_of_adult_downloadquestion: | Your form is ready to download.subquestion: | Thank you ${ user_name_first_new }.

If there are no overflow_fields or each overflow_field is below the specified limit for that field, no addendum will be generated. You can use the AssemblyLine's default addendum template, which works well for a court form, or you can supply your own template file to use for the addendum. Usually, the addendum will be a Word document so it can expand to fit all of the content. Here is the basic process of using an addendum: set the has_addendum attribute of the ALDocument to True add an ALAddendumField object to the overflow_fields dictionary attribute of the ALDocument for each field that you want to handle in the addendum set the overflow_trigger attribute of the ALAddendumField to match the maximum number of characters or items that may appear in that field optionally, set the value of the label attribute of the ALAddendumField (this is used in the default addendum file) optionally, specify the template file that you want to use for the addendum","s":"Overview","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/aldocument","h":"#overview-1","p":964},{"i":982,"t":"The addendum code does not preserve whitespace; both repeated spaces and new lines will always be condensed.","s":"Assumptions and changes to whitespace","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/aldocument","h":"#assumptions-and-changes-to-whitespace","p":964},{"i":984,"t":"Below is a complete example that demonstrates how to use a custom addendum. the addendum is enabled we specify a custom addendum template we add the reasons_for_request variable to the fields that will be checked for the addendum and say it can contain at most 640 characters we limit the number of characters that will go onto the main PDF form to the \"safe\" number of characters ---objects: - CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss_attachment: ALDocument.using(filename=\"CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss\", title=\"Motion to Dismiss CRA\", enabled=True, has_addendum=True, default_overflow_message=\"[See addendum]\") ---objects: - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(elements=[CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss_attachment], title=\"Forms to download and deliver to court\", filename=\"motion_to_dismiss_CRA.pdf\")---attachment: variable name: CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss_attachment.addendum docx template file: CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss_addendum.docx---code: | CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss_attachment.overflow_fields['reasons_for_request'].overflow_trigger = 640 CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss_attachment.overflow_fields['reasons_for_request'].label = \"Reasons for request\" CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss_attachment.overflow_fields.gathered = True ---attachment: variable name: CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss_attachment[i] name: CRA Motion to Dismiss filename: CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss skip undefined: True pdf template file: CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss.pdf fields: - \"reasons_for_request\": ${ CRA_Motion_to_Dismiss_attachment.safe_value('reasons_for_request') } - \"docket_number\": ${ docket_number } - \"user_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } - \"signature_date\": ${ signature_date } If you would like to make your own custom Addendum file, you can start by examining the generic addendum file included in the AssemblyLine repository.

ALExhibitDocuments have: pre-written questions validation of uploads for both size and valid image or document formats the ability to add a document one page at a time, such as with a smartphone camera the ability to add multiple labeled documents in one go the ability to rearrange pages an optional table of contents an optional cover page for each document optional page numbering optional OCRing To trigger asking for the user to upload documents at a specific time in your interview, you can use the .gather() method of your_document.exhibits.

You can add your own template for the individual cover pages for each document, too. Use the stock cover page template as a model. By default, exhibits are labeled sequentially as A, B, and so on. You can supply your own method for labeling each exhibit by defining the auto_labeler attribute of the your_document.exhibits object to be a Python function that accepts an integer and returns a string. The default labeler is just the Docassemble function alpha. If, for example, you wanted to use Roman numerals: mandatory: Truecode: | exhibit_attachment.exhibits.auto_labeler = roman where roman is referring to the Docassemble function. You can also define your own labeling function, like: mandatory: Truecode: | exhibit_attachment.exhibits.auto_labeler = lambda y: str(y+1) Which would make the exhibit labels 1, 2, and so on.

If an address is an ALAddress, it has an address_fields() method that can be used inside a fields: code: | statement to insert a consistently formatted series of address fields. address_fields() will include an autocomplete method and is internationalized. Assembly Line question library questions use ALAddress objects for both the address and mailing_address attributes of people. Example: ---objects: - the_address: ALAddress---id: address questionsets: - the_address.address - the_address.cityquestion: | What is the address?fields: - code: | the_address.address_fields() See Addresses for more information and examples. note You must use sets with the address_fields() method. Otherwise Docassemble will not be able to find the block to provide a definition of the address fields. The address_fields() method includes the following optional parameters: country_code: if provided, will be used to control the list of states that is displayed as well as the default country in the country drop down. In the Assembly Line question library, country_code typically defaults to the value of AL_DEFAULT_COUNTRY default_state: default state, province, or sub locality. In the Assembly Line question library, default_state typically defaults to the value of AL_DEFAULT_STATE show_country: defaults to False. If enabled, a country drop down menu will be displayed. ALAddressList​ The ALAddressList class is a collection of ALAddresses. It is used to allow you to collect multiple addresses in one go and otherwise works exactly like the built-in Docassemble DAList object. The __str__() method of an ALAddressList has been modified so that using it displays a series of addresses on one line, separated by ;. This is used any place that Docassemble treats the variable as text, such as in a template, attachment block, or in a question or subquestion field.

ALIndividual objects include the following methods that are not in the stock Individual class: signature_if_final(i) is meant to be used inside a template or attachment block with the ALDocument class. It displays the signature if and only if i == 'final'. phone_numbers() displays either mobile_number, phone_number, or both if both are present for use in a PDF form with only one space to list phone numbers. contact_methods() displays a list of the contact methods the user provided in the default question library \"contact information\" screen as a formatted string. Specifically, it will display mobile_number, phone_number, email, and other_contact_method. This may be helpful in a formatted letter. age_in_years() returns the individual's age as an integer (whole number), calculated from the individual's birthdate attribute. formatted_age() is like age_in_years() but returns a formatted string with years, months, weeks, and days included when relevant. The cutoff is 2 weeks to display days, 2 years to display months, and anything over 2 years displays only years. name_fields(person_or_business:str = 'person', show_suffix=True) is like address_fields() and is used to display a list of either 3 or 4 fields for a person's name. See Names address_fields() is a wrapper around the address_fields() method of an ALAddress with the same parameters. gender_fields(show_help=False) is like the address_fields() method but displays a list of vetted gender options. Read more about gender questions. pronoun_fields() displays a question that allows the user to provide their pronouns, with multiple choice and a fill-in-the-blank option. See pronouns. initials() is used to return a string with the 1, 2, or 3 initial letters of a person's name. E.g., QKS for Quinten K Steenhuis. language_fields(choices=List[Dict[str, str]]) provides a language selector that sets the .language attribute of the user, together with an other fill-in. This should be the two-letter ISO language code. We recommend defining and passing a dictionary named al_language_user_choices which will also be used by built-in questions triggered from ql_baseline.yml. language_name() will return the language name in English. If there is a system-wide translation words.yml translation file and the user's interface is in that language, the language name will be translated. If the user selected an other option, the other option will be returned. Read-only attributes: The following are all read-only attributes you can use with PDF checkbox fields. They return True or False depending on the value of the gender attribute. gender_male gender_female gender_nonbinary gender_other (True if and only if the gender attribute is not \"female\" or \"male\") gender_unknown gender_self_described Relation to the Individual class​ The ALIndividual class inherits from Docassemble's Individual class, and all other methods of Individual work the same way as they do in the Individual class. ALPeopleList​ The ALPeopleList class is used to represent a group of people. Otherwise it works exactly like the built-in Docassemble DAList object. It also has the following additional methods: familiar() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with and joining the last two items familiar_or() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with or joining the last two items short_list(limit:int, truncate_string:str=', et. al.') returns a list that will be cut off at the limit provided. By default, , et. al. is appended.

Relation to the DAList class​ ALPeopleList inherits from Docassemble's DAList class, and retains all methods and attributes of a DAList. Specifically, the language methods, including the pronoun() and related methods, can be used to display the correct pronoun depending on the number and gender of the members of an ALPeopleList. E.g., users.pronoun_possessive() will return her if there is a single user with the gender attribute value \"female\", and their if there are multiple members of the list. These methods can be helpful inside single-language pleading templates but usually should not be used inside the interview itself, as they can make translation challenging. While there are language-specific versions of these methods, they can lead to odd ungrammatical \"fragments\".

This tool helps you solve steps 3 and 4; users submitting feedback to you, and you being able to triage that feedback. Since much docassemble development already involves GitHub, the AssemblyLine uses GitHub's issues to handle and triage feedback. GitHub issues let you tag user feedback as such, link issues to PRs that fix the code, and track when the fix has been added to the code. GitHub is more developer focused, but it's a good tool to use if you don't currently track interview issues.

The MassAccess project uses the suffolklitlab-issues account to make issues, as seen in this example issue. token should be a GitHub personal access token associated with the user given in username. See the instruction for making a personal access token for more info. The feedback interview will save the feedback on the server with or without the above information, so you don't have to setup a GitHub account to get feedback from users. default repository owner should be your main GitHub organization or account that owns most of your interviews. For example, SuffolkLITLab, which owns MassAccess's repositories, and Illinois Legal Aid Online's GitHub account. allowed repository owners is optional, but necessary if your default repository owner doesn't own all of the repositories that you need to provide feedback for. If you want to be able to make issues on repositories from different organizations, you'll need to list each of them here. For example, Suffolk additionally hosts interviews made by MassLegalHelp. This is so users can't use your tool to spam issues on other organizations' GitHub repos. feedback session linking helps you as the server administrator debug tricky bugs. If this is set to True and if the user agrees, the feedback interview will save the session ID of their current interview on the server and link it to their feedback issue on github. This means that you can see the state of their interview when the user ran into their problem, making it easier to reproduce and fix their bug. You can browse the linked sessions in browse_feedback_sessions.yml. ask panel will add a question to the feedback interview, asking users if they want to be in a panel for user testing.

First, find an interview you'd like to add a feedback widget to. Where exactly you want to ask for feedback is up to you, but we'd recommend doing it where a user has reached an end point.

Errors combining two branches, trouble merging, trouble combining, resolve merge conflicts, fixing merge conflicts between two branches, branches diverged Sometimes when you start to make a pull request, GitHub will tell you that you have a merge conflict. This means that while you were making changes to your branch, changes were also made to the branch you are trying to merge with and they changed the same lines of code. Git will not decide which bits of code to keep where - you have to decide that. These are unavoidable and a pain to deal with. Everyone runs into them now and again and they are tricky to resolve without introducing bugs. tip Ways to reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts: If possible, make the goals of your branches small so that you only make a few changes on a branch before making a pull request with it. Merge pull requests in the order they were made. Avoid editing the same sections of code at the same time. If you are working with collaborators, try to make sure you are working on tasks that do not edit the same lines. You can still make your pull request, but GitHub will prohibit merging. There are two ways GitHub might handle merge conflicts: GitHub allows you to 'resolve' the conflict in GitHub itself by editing the files in GitHub. GitHub is unable to help you resolve the issue (it doesn't offer the option). Either way, the most reliable way to deal with this situation is, unfortunately, to redo your changes on top of the new code: Make the pull request as usual, and use it as a tool. The changes you made will be highlighted in the file comparison tab. In docassemble create a new Project and pull in the other branch (the one you want to merge with). Using the file comparison as a guide, manually add your changes back.

But if you cannot find a matching label, use the general rules below to add as many custom labels as you need. Labels should be valid Python variable names that start with a letter​ PDF and DOCX labels should also work as valid Python variable names. The basic rule is that Python variable names need to start with a letter and can only contain letters, digits, and the _ underscore character. Some variable names are reserved and have a special meaning inside AssemblyLine interviews. You should not use a variable name on the reserved list. Doing so can lead to hard to track bugs. Variable names are case sensitive - make them all lowercase​ Field names are case sensitive. The convention is to never re-use variable names with different capitalizations to store different things. Stick with all lower case names for fields when possible. Use the Python snake_case format for field labels​ In PDFs, labels should be all one word, lowercase, with multiple words separated by an underscore, the _ character. This convention is called snake_case. Do not use a . symbol or [] inside a PDF field's label. In a DOCX file, you can use the . symbol as well as brackets [] but they have a special meaning. The . separates an object from its attribute, and the [] indicates that you are referencing a list of items. Beginners should avoid these symbols except when instructed to do so for one of the variable names below. Use short but descriptive labels​ Use variable names that are descriptive but also short. Avoid using abbreviations. A good rule of thumb is to spell out acronyms and initialisms for clarity, but to freely remove words other than nouns and verbs to keep the names short. Use a name you would still understand if you read it in a year. About 30 characters is a good limit to the length of a variable name. It's unusual to need more than that. If your variable name is shorter than 5 characters, it might not be descriptive enough. Some suggestions for coming up with custom labels​ There are no hard and fast rules other than the ones listed above, but here are some conventions that may help you: Drop words from the variable name that don't add specific meaning. Filler words like \"a\", \"the\", etc. are almost never needed. Stick with nouns and verbs. Yes/no variables (also called boolean) commonly start with a form of the verb \"to be\" or \"to have\", paired with a noun. E.g., is_attorney or has_notice_to_quit. You can also use other verbs--writes_docassemble or saved_status or wants_copies_returned. Do not include the type of variable in the variable name itself. It is usually redundant and is not a common Python style. Exception: you might add something like _list or _date that is both a type and is descriptive of the variable's real world contents. There are now a number of samples of interviews built with the Assembly Line framework that you can find online. You can get ideas for variable names to use in your interview that match if they apply to the same concepts. When you're stuck, feel free to ask for help! It's a good idea to get a second opinion the first few times you label a document. A fellow programmer may have some good ideas to make your variable names shorter, clearer, or more closely follow programming conventions.","s":"General rules for labels","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables","h":"#general-rules-for-labels","p":1473},{"i":1483,"t":"We have identified common fields that exist in most paper court forms: names of people addresses information that identifies the court signatures dates currency figures a pair of yes/no checkboxes docket numbers or court filing numbers We came up with a convention to identify the roles that people may play in relation to your form: The \"user\" of the form: the person who the form is being filed for, making a request or response to the court The \"other_party\" of the form: the person who the user is responding to or suing We have also identified some common names for people that appear across many forms.

The Docassemble and DOCX variable name users[0] is the equivalent of users or users1 in a PDF label. users[1] is the equivalent of user2.

If the times per year does not exist in the given list, it will return a literal string like \"five times per year\". Fractional or floating point-based times_per_year are permissible in the times_per_year_list, although they are not commonly used. E.g., .5 would represent \"every two years\". Items not contained in the list (to provide a specific lookup name) will have a string representation that is rounded to the nearest whole integer. recent_years​ def recent_years(past: int = 25, order: str = \"descending\", future: int = 1) -> List[int] Returns a list of the most recent past years, continuing into the future.

The field can manage items that are either strings or list-like structures. Handling of dictionary overflow is not currently supported. Attributes: field_name str - The name of a docassemble variable that this object represents. overflow_trigger Union[int, bool] - Specifies the limit after which the text is truncated and moved to an addendum. If set to True, it will always overflow. If set to False, it will never overflow. An integer value represents the maximum character count before overflow. headers Optional[Dict[str, str]] - Mapping of attributes to their display labels for a table representation. Planned for future implementation. field_style Optional[str] - Style of the field, can be one of [\"list\", \"table\", \"string\"]. Defaults to \"string\". Planned for future implementation. Notes: The attributes headers and field_style are planned for future releases and are not currently implemented. overflow_value​ def overflow_value(preserve_newlines: bool = False, input_width: int = 80, overflow_message: str = \"\", preserve_words: bool = True) -> Any Retrieve the overflow portion of a variable that exceeds the content of safe_value(). This function addresses both list-like objects and strings, ensuring that the returned overflow content adheres to whitespace preferences specified by the parameters. Arguments: preserve_newlines bool, optional - Determines the treatment of newline characters. If True, the returned string can contain single newline characters. Sequences of newline characters, including Windows-style \"rn\", will be reduced to a single \"n\". Double spaces will be replaced with a single space. If False, all whitespace, including newlines and tabs, will be replaced with a single space. Defaults to False. input_width int, optional - The width of the input field or display area, used for determining overflow. Defaults to 80. overflow_message str, optional - Message indicating overflow in the safe value. Defaults to \"\". preserve_words bool, optional - If True, ensures words are not split between the main content and the overflow. Defaults to True. Returns: Any - The portion of the variable exceeding the content safe for display, considered as overflow. max_lines​ def max_lines(input_width: int = 80) -> int Compute the maximum number of lines that can fit in the input given the specified input width. Arguments: input_width int, optional - The width of the input or display area. Defaults to 80. Returns: int - The maximum number of lines accommodated by the input width. value​ def value() -> Any Retrieve the complete value without considering overflow constraints. This can be especially helpful in appendices where there's a desire to showcase the entire value without the necessity of toggling between various sections or pages. Returns: Any - The whole value of the field, irrespective of overflow. has_overflow​ def has_overflow(overflow_message: str = \"\", input_width: int = 80, preserve_newlines: bool = False, _original_value: Optional[str] = None, preserve_words: bool = True) -> bool Return True only if the value's length exceeds the overflow trigger. Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box. Defaults to 80. preserve_newlines bool - Determines whether newlines are preserved in the \"safe\" text. Defaults to False, which means all newlines are removed. This allows more text to appear before being sent to the addendum. _original_value Any - for speed reasons, you can provide the full text and just use this method to determine if the overflow trigger is exceeded. If no _original_value is provided, this method will determine it using the value_if_defined() method. preserve_words bool - If True, the algorithm will try to preserve whole words when truncating the text. If False, the algorithm will truncate the text at the overflow trigger, regardless of whether it is in the middle of a word. Returns: bool - True if the value's length exceeds the overflow trigger, False otherwise. original_or_overflow_message​ def original_or_overflow_message( overflow_message: str = \"\", input_width: int = 80, preserve_newlines: bool = False, _original_value: Optional[str] = None, preserve_words: bool = True) -> Union[str, List[Any]] Return the original value if it is less than the overflow trigger (once processed), otherwise return the overflow message. Unlike safe_value(), this will never output a partial value. Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box. Defaults to 80. preserve_newlines bool - Determines whether newlines are preserved in the \"safe\" text. Defaults to False, which means all newlines are removed. This allows more text to appear before being sent to the addendum. _original_value Any - for speed reasons, you can provide the full text and just use this method to determine if the overflow trigger is exceeded. If no _original_value is provided, this method will determine it using the value_if_defined() method. preserve_words bool - If True, the algorithm will try to preserve whole words when truncating the text. If False, the algorithm will truncate the text at the overflow trigger, regardless of whether it is in the middle of a word. Returns: Union[str, List[Any]]: Either a string representing the overflow message or the original value safe_value​ def safe_value(overflow_message: str = \"\", input_width: int = 80, preserve_newlines: bool = False, _original_value: Optional[str] = None, preserve_words: bool = True) -> Union[str, List[Any]] Return just the portion of the variable that heuristics suggest will fit in the specified overflow_trigger limit. If the value is not defined, return an empty string. When preserve_newlines is True, the output will be limited to a number of lines, not a number of characters. The max number of lines will be calculated as floor(self.overflow_trigger/input_width). Therefore, it is important that input_width is a divisor of overflow_trigger. Whitespace will be altered. If preserve_newlines is true, the return value may have newlines, but double newlines and Windows style (rn) will be replaced with n. Double spaces will be replaced with a single space. If preserve_newlines is false, all whitespace, including newlines and tabs, will be replaced with a single space. Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box.

Returns: Union[str, List[Any]]: The portion of the variable that fits within the overflow trigger. value_if_defined​ def value_if_defined() -> Any Fetch the value of the designated field if it exists; otherwise, return an empty string. This method ensures that the addendum does not inadvertently trigger docassemble's variable gathering. Returns: Any - The value of the field if it exists, otherwise an empty string. __str__​ def __str__() Represent the ALAddendumField instance as a string. Returns: str - The string representation of the value contained within the field. columns​ def columns(skip_empty_attributes: bool = True, skip_attributes: Optional[set] = None) -> Optional[list] Return a list of the attributes present within the object that would make sense to go in the table of an addendum. If the headers attribute exists, this will be prioritized. Otherwise, the method will infer columns from the first value in the list. Empty attributes and the complete attribute are typically ignored. Arguments: skip_empty_attributes bool, optional - Determines whether empty attributes are included in the list. Defaults to True. skip_attributes Optional[set], optional - A set of attributes to ignore. Defaults to {\"complete\"}. Returns: Optional[list] - A list of columns or None if no meaningful columns can be determined. Notes: The \"location\" attribute of an Address object is always skipped in the column list. type​ def type() -> str Determine the data type of the contained value. Categories: 'list': A simple list. 'object_list': A list containing dictionaries or objects. 'other': Any other type. Returns: str - The type category of the value. is_list​ def is_list() -> bool Check if the field contains a list value, whether it consists of objects, dictionaries, or standard values. Returns: bool - True if the field contains a list, otherwise False. is_object_list​ def is_object_list() -> bool Determine if the field contains a list of dictionaries or objects. Returns: bool - True if the field contains a list of dictionaries or objects, otherwise False. overflow_markdown​ def overflow_markdown() -> str Generate a markdown representation of the overflow values. The method returns either a markdown table or a bulleted list based on the structure of the values. This utility offers a standardized way to represent overflow content, though users might prefer to manually control the output's format. Returns: str - A markdown representation of the overflow values. overflow_docx​ def overflow_docx( path: str = \"docassemble.ALDocumentDict:data/templates/addendum_table.docx\") -> Any Insert a formatted table into a docx file, representing the overflow values. This method provides a convenient way to add overflow content into a docx file, although it doesn't offer formatting control. If more formatting flexibility is required, consider directly fetching the overflow values using the overflow_value() method. Arguments: path str, optional - Path to the template docx file to be used. Defaults to a predetermined path.

Typically there are three: The final version of a document with a signature. E.g., my_doc['final']. The preview version of a document with no signature. E.g., my_doc['preview']. An addendum of a document contained in the attribute addendum. E.g. my_doc.addendum. There is no limit to the number of keys, but the ALDocumentBundle class expects at least a \"final\" key to exist, and the addendum attribute is required if you desire to use PDF documents with text overflow. It is best practice to use exactly the two keys \"final\" and \"preview\" and the attribute \"addendum\". The \"final\" and \"preview\" documents will normally be the same template, but with logic controlling the display of a particular section, such as the signature. Each form that an interview generates should get its own ALDocument object. The \"addendum\" attribute can be handled in a generic object block. Multiple documents can use the same addendum template, with just the case caption varying. ALDocuments are designed to be used contingently as part of ALDocumentBundle objects. Each ALDocument is considered to be \"enabled\" or \"disabled\" for a particular interview user's session. This allows you to always work with a single object representing all of the possible documents an interview can generate, and use encapsulated logic to trigger individual documents inclusion on the final download screen. Attributes: filename str - name used for output PDF title str - display name for the output PDF enabled bool - if this document should be created. See examples. addendum DAFile | DAFileCollection - (optional) an attachment block overflow_fields ALAddendumField - (optional) ALAddendumFieldDict instance. These values will be used to detect and handle overflow. has_addendum bool - (optional) Defaults to False. Set to True if the document could have overflow, like for a PDF template. Notes: The enabled attribute should always be defined by a code block or the objects block, because by default it is considered fresh on each page load. If your interview logic requires that you directly ask the user whether or not to include a document, you can use a single intermediate variable that is posed to the interview user to work around this limitation.

Examples: >>> get_adjusted_character_count({\"type\"}: InputType.CHECKBOX) 4.7 >>> get_adjusted_character_count({\"max_length\": 100}) 9.4 >>> get_adjusted_character_count({\"max_length\": 300}) 230 >>> get_adjusted_character_count({\"max_length\": 600}) 115 >>> get_adjusted_character_count({\"max_length\": 1200}) 1150 time_to_answer_field​ def time_to_answer_field(field: FieldInfo, new_name: str, cpm: int = 40, cpm_std_dev: int = 17) -> Callable[[int], np.ndarray] Apply a heuristic for the time it takes to answer the given field, in minutes. It is hand-written for now. It will factor in the input type, the answer type (slot in, gathered, third party or created), and the amount of input text allowed in the field. The return value is a function that can return N samples of how long it will take to answer the field (in minutes) time_to_answer_form​ def time_to_answer_form(processed_fields, normalized_fields) -> Tuple[float, float] Provide an estimate of how long it would take an average user to respond to the questions on the provided form. We use signals such as the field type, name, and space provided for the response to come up with a rough estimate, based on whether the field is: fill in the blank gathered - e.g., an id number, case number, etc. third party: need to actually ask someone the information - e.g., income of not the user, anything else? created: a. short created (3 lines or so?) b. long created (anything over 3 lines) cleanup_text​ def cleanup_text(text: str, fields_to_sentences: bool = False) -> str Apply cleanup routines to text to provide more accurate readability statistics. text_complete​ def text_complete(prompt: str, max_tokens: int = 500, creds: Optional[OpenAiCreds] = None, temperature: float = 0) -> str Run a prompt via openAI's API and return the result. Arguments: prompt str - The prompt to send to the API. max_tokens int, optional - The number of tokens to generate. Defaults to 500. creds Optional[OpenAiCreds], optional - The credentials to use. Defaults to None. temperature float, optional - The temperature to use. Defaults to 0. complete_with_command​ def complete_with_command(text, command, tokens, creds: Optional[OpenAiCreds] = None) -> str Combines some text with a command to send to open ai. needs_calculations​ def needs_calculations(text: Union[str, Doc]) -> bool A conservative guess at if a given form needs the filler to make math calculations, something that should be avoided. If get_passive_sentences​ def get_passive_sentences( text: Union[List, str]) -> List[Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, int]]]] Return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a sentence in which passive voice was detected along with a list of the starting and ending position of each fragment that is phrased in the passive voice. The combination of the two can be used in the PDFStats frontend to highlight the passive text in an individual sentence. Text can either be a string or a list of strings. If provided a single string, it will be tokenized with NTLK and sentences containing fewer than 2 words will be ignored. get_citations​ def get_citations(text: str, tokenized_sentences: List[str]) -> List[str] Get citations and some extra surrounding context (the full sentence), if the citation is fewer than 5 characters (often eyecite only captures a section symbol for state-level short citation formats) substitute_phrases​ def substitute_phrases( input_string: str, substitution_phrases: Dict[str, str]) -> Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, int]]] Substitute phrases in the input string and return the new string and positions of substituted phrases. Arguments: input_string str - The input string containing phrases to be replaced. substitution_phrases Dict[str, str] - A dictionary mapping original phrases to their replacement phrases. Returns: Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, int]]]: A tuple containing the new string with substituted phrases and a list of tuples, each containing the start and end positions of the substituted phrases in the new string. Example: >>> input_string = \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\" >>> substitution_phrases = {\"quick brown\": \"swift reddish\", \"lazy dog\": \"sleepy canine\"} >>> new_string, positions = substitute_phrases(input_string, substitution_phrases) >>> print(new_string) \"The swift reddish fox jumped over the sleepy canine.\" >>> print(positions) [(4, 17), (35, 48)] substitute_neutral_gender​ def substitute_neutral_gender( input_string: str) -> Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, int]]] Substitute gendered phrases with neutral phrases in the input string. Primary source is https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/inclusive-language substitute_plain_language​ def substitute_plain_language( input_string: str) -> Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, int]]] Substitute complex phrases with simpler alternatives. Source of terms is drawn from https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/ transformed_sentences​ def transformed_sentences( sentence_list: List[str], fun: Callable) -> List[Tuple[str, str, List[Tuple[int, int]]]] Apply a function to a list of sentences and return only the sentences with changed terms. The result is a tuple of the original sentence, new sentence, and the starting and ending position of each changed fragment in the sentence. parse_form​ def parse_form(in_file: str, title: Optional[str] = None, jur: Optional[str] = None, cat: Optional[str] = None, normalize: bool = True, spot_token: Optional[str] = None, tools_token: Optional[str] = None, openai_creds: Optional[OpenAiCreds] = None, rewrite: bool = False, debug: bool = False) Read in a pdf, pull out basic stats, attempt to normalize its form fields, and re-write the in_file with the new fields (if rewrite=1). If you pass a spot token, we will guess the NSMI code. If you pass openai creds, we will give suggestions for the title and description. form_complexity​ def form_complexity(stats) Gets a single number of how hard the form is to complete. Higher is harder.","s":"AnswerType Objects","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/reference/formfyxer/lit_explorer","h":"#answertype-objects","p":1693},{"i":1702,"t":"In Docassemble, a review screen is the way that a user can make changes to their answers. A review screen displays one or more of the user's existing answers along with buttons that let the user edit each choice.

Like the list of fields in a question screen, one review screen can let the user review many answers. This list of answers goes under the heading review instead of fields. Each answer you want to let your user change includes: A button, with a label of your choice (we usually use \"Edit\") Fields that you want the user to revisit when they click the edit button Some preview of the user's current answer. It's common to repeat or paraphrase the question from the interview and show the answer next to the question. You can do more advanced things with review screens, too: If you want the user to jump to another screen, perhaps they could edit multiple fields asked over several different screens in the interview, you can make the field name point to another question screen, labeled with an event. This is usually used to edit lists of people with a revisit block. You can trigger follow-up code to run after the user makes a change. For example: you can trigger a code block to re-run, delete the value of another answer, or trigger another follow-up screen. Writing a review screen is important. Without one, the only way a user can change their answers is with the \"back\" button, but the \"back\" button will undo the user's progress in the interview so far. Review screens are necessary for interviews to be fully WCAG compliant; for legal applications, WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.4 requires that a mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission For docassemble applications, this means a review screen that allows the user to correct the information they entered needs to be present at the end of your interview.","s":"Why make a review screen?","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/review_screen","h":"#why-make-a-review-screen","p":1699},{"i":1707,"t":"Large changes to an interview's logic will require large changes to the review screen as well.

You can download the YAML file either: from the docassemble playground, clicking on the \"Download\" button below the YAML editor, or from GitHub. For example, for the Motion to Stay Eviction, you can navigate to the primary YAML file, SP6A.yml, and click the \"download raw file\" button. You should download all of the YAML files that define variables used in your interview. The more YAML files you download, the more content you might have to cut from the generated review screen. Once you have the YAML files, go to the ALDashboard's review screen generator, and upload your YAML files. You should leave the two checkboxes (\"create revisit screens\", and \"point section blocks to review screen\") checked, and press \"continue\". The next screen will have your review blocks! Make a file called review.yml in your playground, and copy the content from the review screen generator into it.

In short, something like this: event: |- review_introcode: |- review_form is the same as this: event: review_introcode: | review_form I'd recommend changing the YAML to how you normally write it to be more concise 1. The remainder of the examples will use the more concise YAML notation. There are a few sections of the generated review screen YAML: There are the events. These blocks look like this: event: review_introcode: | review_form---event: review_prior_casecode: | review_form These blocks take each section from your interview and make it so that if a user clicks on the section, they are brought to the review page. In our experience, this works best, as all of the information that the interview asks can be edited in one place, and the user doesn't have to remember which section a piece of information belonged to. The main review block. The block looks like this: id: review screenevent: review_formquestion: | Review your answersreview: - Edit: users.revisit button: | **Users** % for item in users: - ${ item } % endfor - Edit: has_existing_case button: | **Do you have an existing Michigan family court case?** Do you have an existing Michigan family court case?: ${ word(yesno(has_existing_case)) } This block looks like a normal question block, except there is a review attribute instead of fields. Each list item under the review attribute is generated from question screens in the interview, and shows the text content and the fields from that question screen. Each element in the review can have the following dictionary attributes: Edit adds an \"Edit\" button in this section of the review screen. When clicked, the \"Edit\" button will take the user to fields on the right side of the : they have already answered. These fields can be: A single field, e.g. Edit: has_existing_case A list of fields. Each of the fields will be re-shown to the user. e.g. - Edit: - who_pays - which_side_pays You can also use recompute as an item in the list that contains a sub-list of fields to re-calculate using code blocks, without asking questions to the user again. You won't see recompute in your generated interview, but you should add it if necessary. Here's an example: - Edit: - county_choice - recompute: - trial_court button acts like the subquestion of this section of the review screen. It is where you should display the current value of the field or fields you want to let the user edit. You can use multiple lines and Mako tags in this area. The revisit screens. These blocks look like this: id: revisit userscontinue button field: users.revisitquestion: | Edit your answers about Userssubquestion: | ${ users.table } ${ users.add_action() } Revisit screens are used to let people edit items in DALists. For each of the other variables in the review block, clicking their \"Edit\" button brings users directly to the question to let them edit their answers. That approach works well for simple variables like text, dates that the user enters, or yes no questions. But your interview might include objects and lists of objects, like a list of plaintiffs and another list of defendants. Instead of re-asking every question that someone answered to fill the list, docassemble brings to the user to a revisit screen that shows each item in the list to the user, and lets them choose which to edit individually. If you used the Weaver to make your interview, your interview might have a few different lists for people, like users, other_parties, children, debt_collectors, and guardians. The revisit screens each show the table attribute of the DAList. If needed, blocks defining the table for the lists will appear at the end of the generated review file. table: children.tablerows: childrencolumns: - Birthdate: | row_item.birthdate if hasattr(row_item, 'birthdate') else ''edit: - birthdate Edits to the Review Screen​ You'll want to change some aspects of the generated review screen. Note that if any errors happen in a specific edit element on the review screen, that element won't appear. It also won't appear if the attribute or variable to be edited doesn't exist. You should make sure that it does. Some common issues to the generated review screen that I personally have run into before: Remove generated revisit and table blocks for attachments and other non-people objects, if any, as well as their entries in the review block. revisit is only needed for things the user enters themselves. Since the review screen generator can't determine which object types people have to enter information for, it generates them for all objects. Remove questions you don't want the user to edit. Sometimes, you will have questions that do set a variable in the interview, but the variable isn't used in the interview logic after that. For example, a question that's only use is to kickout a user if their problem isn't covered by the form. Here's an example of one: ---question: | Are you Filing in a Probate Case?fields: - Is your case a probate case?: probate_case datatype: yesnoradio---event: probate_case_exitquestion: | You cannot continue to use the tool.subquestion: | Based on your answer, you can't use this tool. Probate cases have different procedural rules than other cases. You may want to speak to a lawyer. If you made a mistake, click the **Undo** button. Otherwise, click the **Exit** button to return to Michigan Legal Help.buttons: - Exit: exit url: https://michiganlegalhelp.org If editing the value of a variable like this would only lead the person to a kickout screen and not change any other logic of the interview, then the generated review section should be removed.","s":"Step 2: Understanding and Editing the Generated Review Screen","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/review_screen","h":"#step-2-understanding-and-editing-the-generated-review-screen","p":1699},{"i":1713,"t":"You'll find that certain variables often depend on each other, either explicitly or implicitly. For example, if you have a variable called hearing_date_and_time that you set to hearing_date + \" \" + hearing_time, you should recompute that field whenever the user edits the hearing date or time. You can do something like this to update the variable whenever you edit the hearing date: - label: Edit fields: - hearing_date - recompute: - hearing_date_and_time button: | ... Another example of when two variables are implicitly dependent would be if you asked the user if the plaintiff or defendant is paying child support. If the user changes what side of the case they are on, their answer to what side is paying might change too! You can use a review entry that looks like this to edit both. - label: Edit fields: - user_ask_role - who_paid As mentioned in step 2, if a variable doesn't exist or any errors occur when showing a section of the review screen, that whole section won't be shown. If some of the fields on a screen or optional, then their absence can cause their section of the review screen to not appear. Use showifdef on optional fields, or fields that use show if, to prevent this issue. While writing the review screen, you will likely have to redo your interview logic, so that it doesn't make assumptions about the presence or absence of variables, just their values, which I'd encourage. From the docassemble documentation: For example, if you ask “Do you want to include your cell phone number?” and then you ask “What is your cell phone number,” the user’s cell phone number will be defined. If the user then changes the answer to the “Do you want to include your cell phone number?” question, then you will have a situation where the user’s cell phone number is defined but it should not be used. See the last paragraph of this section of the docassemble documentation for more info. Changing the whitespace and types of strings that are used by the review screen generator isn't possible at the moment.↩","s":"Step 4: Things to add to the review screen","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/review_screen","h":"#step-4-things-to-add-to-the-review-screen","p":1699},{"i":1716,"t":"class TestConversions(unittest.TestCase) Tests conversions.py on the \"vars.json\" file test_parse_case_info​ def test_parse_case_info() Makes sure that participants of the case are parsed fully, needed","s":"TestConversions Objects","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/reference/EFSPIntegration/test/test_conversions","h":"#testconversions-objects","p":1714},{"i":1718,"t":"class TestNoneResp(unittest.TestCase) Tests with none responses conversions.py on the \"vars.json\" file test_none​ def test_none() Makes sure that participants of the case are parsed fully, needed","s":"TestNoneResp Objects","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/reference/EFSPIntegration/test/test_conversions","h":"#testnoneresp-objects","p":1714},{"i":1720,"t":"class TestCourtSwitching(unittest.TestCase) Tests that if we search a case in a grouped court (say peoria) and get back a court from a sub court (peariacr), that the court_id from the found case reflects the sub court.
