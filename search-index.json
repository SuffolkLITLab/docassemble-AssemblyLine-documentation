Google is widely used and free, but usage is reported to Google and used for purposes of selling advertisements. Segment is a commercial analytics tool with a paid tier. An advantage of Google Analytics and Segment is that the data will be stored for the long term and you do not need to worry about persisting it between server outages or upgrades, nor about retaining information long term on your server. A disadvantage is that they rely on well-known user tracking tools that may be blocked by ad-blocking or other security software, so the usage statistics may not be completely accurate. To use this integration: Make sure each question in your interview has an id. The id specifier will be added automatically to interviews created with the Assembly Line Weaver. Example: id: this is the google or segment analytics idquestion: | What is your namefields: - Name: user_name Sign up for Google Analytics or Segment, and follow the Docassemble documentation to enable tracking with the system of your choice. This integration allows for very basic tracking. You can identify popular interviews, screens, and dropoff points. Perhaps the most important thing to track is to assign an id named download to your download screen. Then, inside Google Analytics, you can search for the keyword \"download\" under Behavior | Site Content | All pages. Note that the \"page url\" in Google Analytics will have the name of the package and YAML file inserted into the URL.

The default stores only the zip code, but if you remove all parameters, the user's full interview session will be captured in a simplified state. You can also manually add additional interview variables that you want to store. For example, if you wanted to store the user's city and the list of options they chose for a checkbox variable named user_preference: store_variables_snapshot({ \"zip\": users[0].address.zip, \"city\": users[0].address.city, \"user_preference\": user_preference.true_values() }) Docassemble interviews can store complex nested objects that don't fit neatly in a spreadsheet. If you want to manipulate the data later, you may want to \"flatten\" the data so that it is a neat linear list of fields. That will make later analysis easier. You may also want to adjust the time that the data is stored.

This value can also be fractional if need be; an expense that only needs to be paid once every two years would have a times_per_year of 0.5. expense.source is the source, or name, of the expense. Food expenses could have a source of \"food\". expense.display_name is the name of the source that you want to display to the user. This helps with multi-lingual interviews, where you can show the user the name of the expense, but your interview logic can still refer to a single canonical language name. It also helps add or change additional context to the name that you don't want to write out in your interview logic. For example, expense.source could be \"medical insurance\", but expense.display_name could be \"Medical Insurance (including health, dental, and vision)\". You won't be using ALExpense by itself often though; you'll need a list of expenses from the user, which we'll discuss next.","s":"ALExpense","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/alincome/expenses","h":"#alexpense","p":63},{"i":71,"t":"Let's make a short interview that just asks for someone's expenses.

You can customize the options shown to the user by including a definition of an expense_terms variable in your interview.

For each expense that the user said they have, there will be one question screen, asking for how often they pay for that expense, and how much they pay. If they selected \"other\", they will also be prompted to enter the name of that expense. If you want to change the options for how often they pay the amount, you can define a times_per_year_list, similarly to the expense_terms above. By default, the list contains \"weekly\", \"once every two weeks\", \"twice per month\", \"monthly\", \"once every 3 months\", \"once every 6 months\", and \"yearly\". For this tutorial, let's make that list a little shorter. Add the below block to your code: variable name: times_per_year_listdata: - [52, \"Weekly\"] - [26, \"Once every two weeks\"] - [24, \"Twice per month\"] - [12, \"Monthly\"] - [1, \"Yearly\"] You can show let the user review the expenses they've entered with the following question block: id: expenses reviewquestion: | Review your expensessubquestion: | Here is what you've told us about your monthly expenses.

Subject matter experts, similarly, did not require a long-term commitment to the project, but did require some orientation to understand what an interactive legal application can and should do. Longer-term members of our team fit more naturally into other roles. People often changed roles and overlapped them over the time that they volunteered. For example: almost all of our members did some Docassemble development as they gained comfort and familiarity as the project went on. Project management is a learned skill that fit well with people who were outgoing and organized, and also did not demand extensive coding experience. We found it necessary to have a project manager role to make sure content actually got out the door. Otherwise, apps could spend too much time in the refining stage. The urgency of the pandemic helped us center delivering working apps as a goal.

Very basically, you tell the story table Step what question you want to get to and the variables and values it will need to get there. Whenever the test gets to a page, it checks your story table for any variables that match a variable on the page. When it finds a match, it sets the value of the field. When it's done with a page, it continues to the next page until it reaches the terminal question.

If a test is running while that happens, the page the test is trying to open might take too long to load and the test will fail. This is unhelpful to you because the test stops part way and you cannot tell if it would have failed or passed on its own. The next test might then fail during the same reload. That becomes a problem when a chain of tests fail because of one reload.

Other parts of web accessibility involve writing the interview in a way that the user's browser and other accessibility tools (like screen readers) can understand. Docassemble handles many of these things for you, but there are some parts that you'll have to address when writing your interview.

In docassemble, you should set the alt_text attribute of a DAFile, or use the set_alt_text() function. If you are writing HTML directly, you can add an alt property to any img tags you use (see below). <img src=\"my_image.png\" alt=\"A drawing of a flowchart: the question is 'do you have any children?', the option 'yes' leads to 'scenario 1', and the option 'no' leads to 'scenario 2'.\"/>","s":"Use alt-text with images","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/coding_style_guide/accessibility","h":"#use-alt-text-with-images","p":246},{"i":253,"t":"You should add alt-text to your organizations logo.

The glossary terms feature should be used cautiously, perhaps with additional CSS to make it more distinctive. The risk with this feature is distracting or confusing users.

Forward thinking courts have readability targets of 6th grade. But because people don't just read forms--they answer questions and follow instructions--readability isn't a very good measure of form complexity, at least not on its own: Forms use lots of short text (like: Address, Name, and so on), while readability scores are designed to evaluate long narratives. Litigants answer questions and follow instructions on forms as well as reading words. Answers can require getting information from a third party, finding a specific piece of paper (like an ID card), doing math, or making a decision. Answers can be very sensitive, either because they are about private information, like a Social Security Number, or because they evoke a traumatic response, like details of an assault. Answers come in different formats, too. The difference between checking a box and writing out a long answer is significant. Complexity and sensitivity can't always be avoided. For example: a complaint asking for protection from abuse needs to disclose some information about the abuse. But forms should never impose a burden on the litigant that doesn't have a matching benefit.","s":"Why readability scores aren't good enough","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/complexity/complexity","h":"#why-readability-scores-arent-good-enough","p":381},{"i":387,"t":"We built the RateMyPDF score by combining feedback from: Form automators Form authors Legal aid experts Court staff And our own in-house experience from building the Document Assembly Line.

When you use the color theme generator, at the bottom of the page, you will see a small snippet of code that you can copy into the customs.scss file. For example, your new custom.scss might look like this: // Custom.scss// Option A: Include all of Bootstrap// Include any default variable overrides here (though functions won't be available)$white: #ffffff;$theme-colors: ( \"light\": #d8e2a5, \"dark\": #1b1b1b, \"primary\": #25dec6, \"secondary\": #375b5a, \"info\": #d74d72, \"success\": #0cb545, \"warning\": #f4ca0b, \"danger\": #fa043c,);// Note: we placed our custom.scss file in the bootstrap path for simplicity,// so we use a different path than in the bootstrap documentation// @import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";@import \"bootstrap\";// Then add additional custom code here Once you have written your custom.scss file, you can use the ALDashboard (which you can install on your docassemble server) to compile a custom Bootstrap theme. If you are associated with the Suffolk LITLab and have an account on the Suffolk Development server, you can visit a live version of the tool to try it out. At the end of the tool, download the compiled file, and then add it a docassemble project, in the static folder. You can then reference your new file by adding a bootstrap theme feature to your interview: features: bootstrap theme: my_bootstrap_theme.css Running node and npm to build a Bootstrap config (optional)​ If you don't have access to a docassemble server yourself, you can also compile a bootstrap theme from source using node and npm. Use a computer with a current version of Node. The instructions on this page assume you are using an Ubuntu Linux computer with Node installed, but they should be the same on any workstation. They were tested on a machine running Windows 11 with Ubuntu running under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It also assumes that you have VS Code installed, but you can use any text editor of your choice. First, download the Bootstrap source, and install its dependencies. As of this writing, the latest version you should use is 5.1.3. wget https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v5.1.3/bootstrap-5.1.3-dist.zipunzip bootstrap-5.1.3-dist.zipcd bootstrap-5.1.3npm install Place the custom.scss file you wrote from the above section in the unzipped bootstrap-5.1.3 folder, and use npm to compile the theme file. cd ~/bootstrap-5.1.3npm run css-compile Your new custom.css file is in the ~/bootstrap-5.1.3/dist/css directory.

If you need to check the value of multiple variables in one if statement, you need to use the more complex js show if. When you use js show if, you need to use a JavaScript expression that uses the function val() at least once. val() is a JavaScript function that returns the value of a variable name that is visible on screen. It takes the name of the Docassemble variable in quotes as its only parameter. Here is a small example of a js show if expression: ---id: Tell me more about Respondentquestion: | Tell me more about the ${ other_parties[0] }.fields: - Is ${ other_parties[0] } employed?: other_parties[0].is_employed datatype: yesnoradio - Is ${ other_parties[0] } a parent of your child?: other_parties[0].joint_parent datatype: yesnoradio - ${ other_parties[0] }'s monthly income: other_parties[0].income datatype: currency js show if: | val(\"other_parties[0].is_employed\") && val(\"other_parties[0].joint_parent\") Check the js show if documentation to learn how to use different combinations of values in a js show if expression. The key is that you'll use ordinary JavaScript keywords to do any comparisons.

DOCX variables representing people are all plural. Internally, all variables representing people are plural. PDF label DOCX label Use case user users, user[0], or user[n] (where n is any whole number; use sequentially Will display the full name of the person who is filling out the online form other_party other_parties, other_parties[0], or other_parties[n] The person suing or being sued by the person filling out the form; someone on the \"other side\" of the case. plaintiff plaintiffs, plaintiffs[0], plaintiffs[n] Plaintiff in the case if we don't know if the plaintiff is the user or other party. defendant defendants, defendants[0], defendants[n] Defendant in the case if we don't know if the defendant is the user or other party. petitioner petitioners, petitioners[0], petitioners[n] Petitioner in the case if we don't know if the petitioner is the user or other party. respondent respondents, respondents[0], respondents[n] Plaintiff in the case if we don't know if the plaintiff is the user or other party. If the form has room for two people on one side of the case, you can reference user1 and user2 (on a PDF) or users[0] and users[1] (in a DOCX). It's important to always use one of these 4 labels for people who are actually part of the case, since we use those internally in many many places in our standard questions and to communicate information to the court. Never use names like: Tenant Landlord Parent etc. that can be converted into party labels, like Plaintiff or Defendant, if the form is being used by the tenant or landlord or parent. Every form should have at least one of the 6 party labels above. It's best to use user/users and other_party/other_parties when you know that the form is always used by a plaintiff or defendant. For example, a form that is always used by a tenant in an eviction case will normally get labeled with user/users any place that the form mentions either tenant or defendant. In any form that starts a new case, we can always label the PDF with user where the plaintiff name goes. Use one of these exact prefixes for other \"people\" on the form when at all possible​ You may want to use other kinds of labels on the form for miscellaneous people who are associated with the form, but are not parties to the case. Using one of these labels below that we have pre-selected tells our tool that these are people, so we can handle things like addresses, birth dates, etc. correctly. We can freely add more labels to this list if you need them for your form. Ideally, talk to us about that before running your form through the weaver. Never use any of the labels below when the person identified by the label is a party to the case. For example, if they are the person using the form or the person who is on the opposing side of the case from the user of the form. PDF label DOCX label Use case spouse spouses, spouses[0], spouses[n] A spouse whose information goes on the form but is not a party to the case. child children, children[0], children[n] Any child whose information goes on the form. parent parents, parents[0], parents[n] A parent who is not a party to the case. guardian guardians, guardians[0], guardians[n] A guardian who is not a party to the case. caregiver caregivers guardian_ad_litem guardians_ad_litem attorney attorneys translator translators witness witnesses debt_collector debt_collectors creditor creditors These are are considered the prefixes we described before. unknown_role isn't something our program will account for, but it's a name you can use when you don't know what role name to use. It can remind you (or alert other folks) to get a consult from someone who would know more. People suffixes​ When these are people, they have similar things we want to record about them. For example, their first name (name_first). These will be our suffixes. When a field is for a plaintiff's first name, you will combine the two: plaintiff_name_first. These are pre-defined words you can use as field labels for a plaintiff: Label to use in the PDF When to use it plaintiff Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's full name plaintiff_name The same - label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's full name plaintiff_name_first Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's first name plaintiff_name_middle Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's middle name plaintiff_name_last Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's last name plaintiff_name_suffix Label for a field that asks for the suffix of the plaintiff's name plaintiff_gender Label for a text field asking for the plaintiff to write in their gender plaintiff_gender_female Label for a checkbox for a \"female\" gender choice plaintiff_gender_male Label for a checkbox for a \"male\" gender choice plaintiff_birthdate Label for a single field for the plaintiff's date of birth CONTACT INFORMATION plaintiff_address_address Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's house address plaintiff_address_unit Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's apartment number (deprecated) plaintiff_address_street Label for a field that asks for the plaintiff's house address.

As we said, each field label in a PDF needs to be unique, but some forms ask for a field multiple times. For example, the plaintiff's name might come up more than once. In those cases, you add two underscores (__) and a number. This will go on the very end of the label, after all the suffixes. So, prefix_suffix__2, prefix_suffix__3, and so on: Label to use in the PDF When to use it plaintiff_name_first__2 Label for the second field that asks for that plaintiff's first name plaintiff_name_first__3 Label for the third field that asks for that plaintiff's first name plaintiff__2 Label for the second field that asks for that plaintiff's full name plaintiff__3 Label for the third field that asks for that plaintiff's full name And so on. How about the other person/organization types you told me about? All these pre-defined suffixes work the same for all of the person/organization types we listed.

Also, we can do some automation with custom labels too if they follow certain patterns. Important Rules​ Some things you really need to do or it will be very hard to write code for the labels: Field names must start with a letter or underscore (_) - not a number or anything else. Field names can only include letters, numbers, and underscores. No spaces or any other character. When you run across a large area that gives room for writing a paragraph, make sure it's one big field. Useful label conventions​ Code is also about communicating with each other. The label names you come up with now are ones people will need to work with in the future. You don't have to do too much, but try not to label things with Adobe's defaults or field1, field2, and so on. Here are some suggestions for making helpful labels: Please use all lowercase letters for all labels. The coders will really appreciate it. Separate multiple words in a label with an underscore: plaintiff_does_love_pie Make the labels descriptive. If they can be descriptive and short, that's even better. Avoid acronyms and abbreviations, other than very common ones such as id for identification. When you have several related fields in a row, it could help with automation if you make your own prefix and suffixes. Make a prefix out of the the feature that groups them together, e.g. asset_checking, asset_savings, etc. It makes alphabetical sorting easier. Additional suffixes to help with automation: Use verb/noun pairs for checkboxes. For example, plaintiff_is_parent, defendant_speaks_spanish, petitioner_has_assets, etc. For checkboxes with a yes/no pair, add _yes and _no to the end as an extra suffix.

Handling court hierarchies is a complicated task, and something that the AssemblyLine can't do for you. You'll need to make your own way to let users select what court they want to file in depending on your jurisdiction. See our documentation for al_courts for some possible ideas. You should be able to run the interview now. If this is the first time you're running the interview on the server, you will be asked to log in to eFileIL. If you don't yet have an account, you should be able to make a new pro-se user account with eFileIL by following the links to make a new account on the page. Once you've logged in on the server, subsequent runs of the interview won't ask you to log in, until the eFileIL token expires and you have to log in again, in about 1-2 hours. The next page will ask if you want to search by party name or by case number. For now, let's search by case number. If you select \"case number\", and then enter the case number \"2022SC9\", you should find a case, John Smith vs. Bob Doe, a small claims case. info This case search worked at the time of writing (February 28th, 2023). However, courts have removed older cases from their staging servers before, and it is possible that this search won't work in the future. You can try searching common names like \"John Brown\" or \"John Smith\", or you could ask a court official if they are able to provide you with some testing case numbers from their staging server. We recommend that you build a working relationship with your local courts so they can help you with details like this. You can also go back and search by \"Party name\" instead. You can enter the name \"John Smith\", press continue, and wait. Searching by party name takes longer on eFileIL's server, especially on the staging server, you might have to wait around 30 seconds. Once the search completes, you will see that there are many cases involving John Smith. For speed purposes, the EFSP library only gets information about the first 8, and let's you click the next button to see the next 8. If you select the John Smith vs. Bob Doe case, you then see the last page in the interview YAML; show_all_info. This page shows all of the information that you, the interview author, can use from the case_search.found_case, the variable for the found case. The details and case_details attributes aren't stable APIs, but you might find the following attributes useful: court_id, the court that this case came from. Some courts have sub-courts that handle specific case types, so even though you searched for cases in the \"adams\" court, you should use this value for the rest of the interview. participants, an ALPeopleList object that has all of the participants in the case on both sides. each participant has a party_type and party_type_name, i.e. participants[0].party_type_name might be \"Plaintiff/Petitioner\". These values are Tyler e-filing codes that are set by the court. attorneys is a dictionary that contains any attorneys that are a part of the case. efile_case_type is the Tyler e-filing code for the type of case. This is useful if your interview is only relevant for certain case types. If users don't or can't fill out your form for their case, you can send users to a page that says they don't need this form and why. docket_number has the case number of the court. \"Docket number\" is the term that Massachusetts uses for a unique number assigned to each case by the court.

Including the add_existing_users line triggers code in the EFSPIntegration package that asks the user which participant they are in the case, and then fills in users and other_parties based on that information. If your form generally deals with party types other than \"defendant\" and \"plaintiff\", you will likely want to look at the is_defendant_filters and is_plaintiff_filters variables in docassemble-EFSPIntegration:case_search.yml which you can override to sort participants by their codes from a case into your typical ALPeopleLists in your form.","s":"Using case search data in your Assembly Line interview","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/efiling/case_search","h":"#using-case-search-data-in-your-assembly-line-interview","p":517},{"i":529,"t":"This is a guide to get from a working Assembly Line Interview to an interview that can e-file through our EFSP to the Tyler EFM system. caution This e-filing functionality is being updated often, so this documentation might be out of date.

To keep it simple, the interview will only file one type of case; this lets us hardcode a few pieces of information in our interview. We'll first need to find the right \"codes\" for our interview. Tyler's E-filing system defines specific codes for many different parts of the filing process, include the over-arching category of the case, the more specific case type, and even things like whether or not the filed document should be confidential or not. To find the right codes, navigate through the URLs provided by visiting https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes. Firefox will display clickable links that you can use to browse the different codes. For example, say we want to write an Adoption interview. The codes in Illinois are split by courts, so to see the case categories available to one particular court, say Adams, we can go to https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/categories, and scroll through the responses until we find the \"Adoption\" entry, code 7306. We would then see the case types for Adoption cases in adams at https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/case_types?category_id=7306&timing=Initial, which is 25361. The endpoints should say when they need parameters, like we provided with category_id=7306&timing=Initial above. We are currently working on a better interface for finding and handling these codes at runtime based on our experiences in Illinois and Massachusetts. Stay tuned. For this guide, we'll stick with a single court, to make things simple to understand.

Note that if only a first name is provided, then the person is assumed to be a business. users[0] is almost always the person completing the interview, or at least who the form is being completed on behalf of. For each object in users and in other_parties, your interview needs to define the following attributes: party_type: this should be the Tyler party type code of that user is_new: if you are filing into an existing case and are adding additional participants to the case, this should be true.

The metadata can include things like a case number, the names of parties, and codes that tell a clerk what kind of filing is being delivered. E-filing replaces delivering documents to the court by hand, mail, or courier. Traditionally, e-filing requires visiting a dedicated web page, creating an account, converting documents into PDF format, and then inputting a lot of confusing information, such as document type, filing codes, and court codes. The LIT Lab's primary tool is code that guided interview authors can incorporate to add a simple one-click e-file button into an existing guided interview. The interview author can pre-select or help the litigant select the proper codes. This removes the most challenging part of traditional e-filing. If the litigant qualifies for a fee waiver, they may not even be required to create an account. We have also created a very simple e-filing \"portal\" that works much like traditional e-filing websites. This is not a product we expect end-users to interact with just yet. There are many competing systems of e-filing, but often there is a monopoly vendor within a given jurisdiction.

ALDocumentBundle objects can be nested to allow you to group multiple individual template files into one document that the user can download. Both ALDocument and ALDocumentBundle objects can be either enabled or not. The Docassemble interview will seek logic that defines when the document should be included in the final output, letting you easily create interviews that have contingent documents.","s":"Overview","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/aldocument","h":"#overview","p":573},{"i":578,"t":"An ALDocument is a DADict that has top level attributes and points to one or more Docassemble attachment blocks. There are usually exactly two keys in the dictionary: preview and final, with the only difference being the presence or absence of a signature. Conditional logic inside the template or attachment block can be used to show or hide the signature depending on the value of the key so that the template does not need to be created twice. The signature_if_final method of an ALIndividual was created to simplify this common use case. Here's how to use an ALDocument: Create ALDocument objects in an objects block. Set any required attributes, like enabled, in the object block or in a separate code block. If you set enabled=True in the object block, your document will always be enabled. Define the key of the ALDocument in an attachment block using the variable name modifier. Usually, use one attachment block and define the variable name like this: variable name: some_al_document[i]. Optionally, reference the ALDocument inside an ALDocumentBundle. Example: ---objects: - letter: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"ssa_letter\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False)---attachment: - pdf template file: ssa_letter.pdf variable name: letter[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) }","s":"ALDocument class","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/aldocument","h":"#aldocument-class","p":573},{"i":580,"t":"If other variables in your interview determine if your document is enabled, you should define the enabled attribute in a code block, like this: ---objects: - main_document: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"main_document\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False) - insurance_rider: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"rider\", has_addendum=False)---attachments: - pdf template file: main_document.pdf variable name: main_document[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } - pdf template file: rider.pdf variable name: rider[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) }---code: | if total_cost > 1000: insurance_rider.enabled = True else: insurance_rider.enabled = False # or more concise but slightly harder to read: # insurance_rider.enabled = total_cost > 1000 In the example above, the insurance_rider document is only included in any bundles if the total cost of the project is over $1,000. Note that the enabled value is global for the interview session. If you want to use different logic in different bundles, you can easily create a separate ALDocument that references the same template file and attachment block. Attributes: filename: the display filename used for the document when it is downloaded title: the title shown on the download screen enabled: whether the document should be \"turned on\" when it is referenced in an ALDocumentBundle addendum: points to a variable representing an attachment block with a formatted addendum. The Assembly Line provides a good default addendum template that is flexible enough to work with many fields. overflow_fields: an ALAddendumFieldDict with each representing a field that has potential to be sent to the addendum if exceeds a pre-set length. has_addendum: set this to True or False to control whether the overflow_fields dictionary will be checked to decide whether or not to generate an addendum file. Optional; defaults to False. Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a PDF version of the completed template and any addendum. key is normally preview or final as_docx(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a DOCX version of the completed template and any addendum if the original is a DOCX template. key is normally preview or final. as_list(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a 1 or 2 item list which contains the template and its addendum, if any. need_addendum(): returns True if the addendum exists and there are overflow fields. has_overflow(): returns True if there are fields that trigger the addendum. overflow(): returns a list of just the fields that triggered the addendum. safe_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"safe\" value of field_name (the amount that is less than overflow_trigger) plus an overflow message. Used in an attachment block. overflow_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"unsafe\" value of field_name--the amount that exceeds the overflow_trigger.

Here's how to use an ALDocumentBundle: Create the ALDocumentBundle in an objects block. Add each ALDocument or nested ALDocumentBundle that your interview will sometimes produce to the bundle. Because the list is usually known in advance, it's common to include this in the object definition. Use the as_pdf() method on your preview screen to display a preview of the output without any signature. Use the download_list_html() and send_button_html() methods on your download screen. You can have as many or as few bundles as you would like. The Assembly Line convention is to use the following two bundles: al_user_bundle which should include a next steps document with instructions for your user al_court_bundle which leaves out the instructions and should have every document that you want the clerk to receive Stick with this convention if you expect to integrate with E-filing. Example: ---objects: - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[ssa_next_steps, letter]) - al_court_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[letter]) note You can nest ALDocumentBundles! Just create your bundle in a separate objects block and add it directly into the list of elements. This lets you create a document from multiple templates that you want the user to be able to open and print as one file. Attributes: enabled (optional): define this if the bundle is included inside another ALDocumentBundle. If other variables in your interview determine if it's enabled, you should define the attribute in a code block, like in this earlier example title: this is displayed on the download screen filename: used to construct the display filename for a pdf version of the bundle Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> DAFile: return a single concatenated PDF of the bundle's attachments as_zip(self, key:str = 'final', refresh:bool = True, title:str = '') -> DAFile: returns a compressed ZIP archive with separate documents for each item. enabled_documents(self, refresh:bool=True) -> List[Any]: return a list of only the \"enabled\" documents in the bundle as_flat_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: get_titles(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[str]: as_pdf_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: as_editable_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: download_list_html(self, key:str='final', format:str='pdf', view:bool=True refresh:bool=True, include_zip:bool = True, view_label=\"View\", view_icon:str=\"eye\", download_label:str=\"Download\", download_icon:str=\"download\", zip_label:str=None, zip_icon:str=\"file-archive\") -> str: returns HTML for a table with download and view buttons, as for a download screen send_button_html(self, key:str='final', show_editable_checkbox:bool = True)->str: send_email(self, to:any=None, key:str='final', editable:bool=False, template:any=None, **kwargs) -> bool: Example of a download screen that uses an ALDocumentBundle: ---progress: 100id: downloadevent: petition_to_change_name_of_adult_downloadquestion: | Your form is ready to download.subquestion: | Thank you ${ user_name_first_new }.

Documents uploaded using this class will be added as a standalone file inside the bundle. They will typically fill the full page. This is perfect, for example, if you need the user to upload some critical document and you know exactly which document it is in advance. For example: a notice or letter that you know the user should have received. When the user needs to upload multiple documents and you want to provide flexibility about which documents they upload and what order they are in, it may make more sense to use the ALExhibitDocument class.

If you would like to handle files that are uploaded by the interview user during the course of the interview, the ALExhibitDocument class can handle some of the complexity for you. ALExhibitDocuments have: pre-written questions validation of uploads for both size and valid image or document formats the ability to add a document one page at a time, such as with a smartphone camera the ability to add multiple labeled documents in one go the ability to rearrange pages an optional table of contents an optional cover page for each document optional page numbering optional OCRing To trigger asking for the user to upload documents at a specific time in your interview, you can use the .gather() method of your_document.exhibits. You may want to customize this screen by copying and pasting the block linked above into your interview. This feature is fairly complex, so try just changing the wording and leave the validation code alone. You can use an ALExhibitDocument by creating an ALExhibitDocument in an objects block and adding that object to an ALDocumentBundle. Below is a simple snippet that demonstrates how to use an ALExhibitDocument. we use the default options, which include adding sequential Bates numbers to pages, generating a table of contents, and adding individual cover pages for each exhibit. we trigger the questions about exhibits at a specific point in the interview. we also add the exhibit_attachment document into the ALDocumentBundle by adding it to the elements=[...] list inside the bundle's definition ---objects: - exhibit_attachment: ALExhibitDocument.using( title=\"Exhibits\", filename=\"exhibits\", add_page_numbers=True, include_table_of_contents=True, include_exhibit_cover_pages=True, )---id: interview ordermandatory: Truecode: | al_intro_screen # ... if exhibit_attachment.exhibits.has_exhibits: exhibit_attachment.exhibits.gather() # ...---objects: - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(elements=[my_instructions, my_main_attachment, exhibit_attachment], filename=\"user_bundle.pdf\", title=\"All forms to download for your records\")","s":"Using the full power of ALExhibitDocument","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/aldocument","h":"#using-the-full-power-of-alexhibitdocument","p":573},{"i":608,"t":"You can add your own template for the table of contents by customizing your_document.cover_page. Use the stock table of contents template as a model. It has some fancy math to figure out what page number to start the exhibits at, based on whether it thinks the table of contents itself will spill onto a second page. You can add your own template for the individual cover pages for each document, too. Use the stock cover page template as a model. By default, exhibits are labeled sequentially as A, B, and so on. You can supply your own method for labeling each exhibit by defining the auto_labeler attribute of the your_document.exhibits object to be a Python function that accepts an integer and returns a string. The default labeler is just the Docassemble function alpha. If, for example, you wanted to use Roman numerals: mandatory: Truecode: | exhibit_attachment.exhibits.auto_labeler = roman where roman is referring to the Docassemble function. You can also define your own labeling function, like: mandatory: Truecode: | exhibit_attachment.exhibits.auto_labeler = lambda y: str(y+1) Which would make the exhibit labels 1, 2, and so on.

Optionally, you can tell AssemblyLine interviews to use an improved OCR system, OCRMyPDF. To turn on OCRMyPDF: Install OCRMyPDF as a Debian package inside your docker container. Update your global configuration. Installing OCRMyPDF​ Edit your global configuration and find an entry labeled debian packages. Edit or add it so that it includes ocrmypdf, like this: debian packages:- ocrmypdf Next, you can either start and then stop your Docassemble docker container on the command line, or manually install the application as follows: docker exec -ti [TAB] /bin/bashapt updateapt install ocrmypdf Setting OCRMyPDF as the default OCR engine in AssemblyLine interviews​ Find and edit the assembly line directive in your configuration so that it includes this line: assembly line: ocr engine: ocrmypdf If this setting is missing or the ocr engine is set to anything other than ocrmypdf, the default Docassemble OCR engine will be used instead.","s":"Using advanced OCR settings","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/aldocument","h":"#using-advanced-ocr-settings","p":573},{"i":612,"t":"The ALStaticDocument class is provided to give you a simple method to include plain PDF or Word instructions that do not have any variables included in them and have only one version (rather than a preview and final version).

If an address is an ALAddress, it has an address_fields() method that can be used inside a fields: code: | statement to insert a consistently formatted series of address fields. address_fields() will include an autocomplete method and is internationalized. Assembly Line question library questions use ALAddress objects for both the address and mailing_address attributes of people. Example: ---objects: - the_address: ALAddress---id: address questionsets: - the_address.address - the_address.cityquestion: | What is the address?fields: - code: | the_address.address_fields() See Addresses for more information and examples. note You must use sets with the address_fields() method. Otherwise Docassemble will not be able to find the block to provide a definition of the address fields. The address_fields() method includes the following optional parameters: country_code: if provided, will be used to control the list of states that is displayed as well as the default country in the country drop down. In the Assembly Line question library, country_code typically defaults to the value of AL_DEFAULT_COUNTRY default_state: default state, province, or sub locality. In the Assembly Line question library, default_state typically defaults to the value of AL_DEFAULT_STATE show_country: defaults to False. If enabled, a country drop down menu will be displayed. ALAddressList​ The ALAddressList class is a collection of ALAddresses. It is used to allow you to collect multiple addresses in one go and otherwise works exactly like the built-in Docassemble DAList object. The __str__() method of an ALAddressList has been modified so that using it displays a series of addresses on one line, separated by ;. This is used any place that Docassemble treats the variable as text, such as in a template, attachment block, or in a question or subquestion field. Example: ${ person.previous_addresses } might display 123 Main St, Boston, MA; 456 Broadway, Cambridge, MA. The previous_addresses attribute of an ALIndividual is an ALAddressList.","s":"ALAddress and ALAddressList classes","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/algeneral","h":"#ALAddress","p":617},{"i":624,"t":"The ALIndividual is an extension of the Docassemble Individual class. It should be used to represent both natural people and businesses or other entities. ALIndividual objects include the following methods that are not in the stock Individual class: signature_if_final(i) is meant to be used inside a template or attachment block with the ALDocument class. It displays the signature if and only if i == 'final'. phone_numbers() displays either mobile_number, phone_number, or both if both are present for use in a PDF form with only one space to list phone numbers. contact_methods() displays a list of the contact methods the user provided in the default question library \"contact information\" screen as a formatted string. Specifically, it will display mobile_number, phone_number, email, and other_contact_method. This may be helpful in a formatted letter. age_in_years() returns the individual's age as an integer (whole number), calculated from the individual's birthdate attribute. formatted_age() is like age_in_years() but returns a formatted string with years, months, weeks, and days included when relevant. The cutoff is 2 weeks to display days, 2 years to display months, and anything over 2 years displays only years. name_fields(person_or_business:str = 'person', show_suffix=True) is like address_fields() and is used to display a list of either 3 or 4 fields for a person's name. See Names address_fields() is a wrapper around the address_fields() method of an ALAddress with the same parameters. gender_fields(show_help=False) is like the address_fields() method but displays a list of vetted gender options. Read more about gender questions. initials() is used to return a string with the 1, 2, or 3 initial letters of a person's name. E.g., QKS for Quinten K Steenhuis. language_fields(choices=List[Dict[str, str]]) provides a language selector that sets the .language attribute of the user, together with an other fill-in. This should be the two-letter ISO language code. We recommend defining and passing a dictionary named al_language_user_choices which will also be used by built-in questions triggered from ql_baseline.yml. language_name() will return the language name in English. If there is a system-wide translation words.yml translation file and the user's interface is in that language, the language name will be translated. If the user selected an other option, the other option will be returned. Read-only attributes: The following are all read-only attributes you can use with PDF checkbox fields. They return True or False depending on the value of the gender attribute. gender_male gender_female gender_nonbinary gender_other (True if and only if the gender attribute is not \"female\" or \"male\") gender_unknown gender_self_described Relation to the Individual class​ The ALIndividual class inherits from Docassemble's Individual class, and all other methods of Individual work the same way as they do in the Individual class. ALPeopleList​ The ALPeopleList class is used to represent a group of people. Otherwise it works exactly like the built-in Docassemble DAList object. It also has the following additional methods: familiar() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with and joining the last two items familiar_or() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with or joining the last two items short_list(limit:int, truncate_string:str=', et. al.') returns a list that will be cut off at the limit provided. By default, , et. al. is appended. The text can be customized. note In the lists above, and and or can be translated using words.yml) Example: users.short_list(2) will display John Smith and Jane Smith, et. al. if the list contains John Smith, Jane Smith, and Jane Doe. et al is not used if the list is at or below the limit provided. Relation to the DAList class​ ALPeopleList inherits from Docassemble's DAList class, and retains all methods and attributes of a DAList. Specifically, the language methods, including the pronoun() and related methods, can be used to display the correct pronoun depending on the number and gender of the members of an ALPeopleList. E.g., users.pronoun_possessive() will return her if there is a single user with the gender attribute value \"female\", and their if there are multiple members of the list. These methods can be helpful inside single-language pleading templates but usually should not be used inside the interview itself, as they can make translation challenging. While there are language-specific versions of these methods, they can lead to odd ungrammatical \"fragments\". As tedious as it may be, the best practice for translation inside the interview is to use conditional logic for full sentences matching each gender and number.","s":"ALIndividual and ALPeopleList classes","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/algeneral","h":"#ALIndividual","p":617},{"i":626,"t":"Currently, the Assembly Line interviews provide these classes that you can use to target questions to a specific type of person: Tenant HousingAuthority Applicant Abuser Survivor Each class subclasses ALIndividual and shares its methods and attributes.

Since much docassemble development already involves GitHub, the AssemblyLine uses GitHub's issues to handle and triage feedback. GitHub issues let you tag user feedback as such, link issues to PRs that fix the code, and track when the fix has been added to the code. GitHub is more developer focused, but it's a good tool to use if you don't currently track interview issues.

The MassAccess project uses the suffolklitlab-issues account to make issues, as seen in this example issue. token should be a GitHub personal access token associated with the user given in username. See the instruction for making a personal access token for more info. The feedback interview will save the feedback on the server with or without the above information, so you don't have to setup a GitHub account to get feedback from users. default repository owner should be your main GitHub organization or account that owns most of your interviews. For example, SuffolkLITLab, which owns MassAccess's repositories, and Illinois Legal Aid Online's GitHub account. allowed repository owners is optional, but necessary if your default repository owner doesn't own all of the repositories that you need to provide feedback for. If you want to be able to make issues on repositories from different organizations, you'll need to list each of them here. For example, Suffolk additionally hosts interviews made by MassLegalHelp. This is so users can't use your tool to spam issues on other organizations' GitHub repos. feedback session linking helps you as the server administrator debug tricky bugs. If this is set to True and if the user agrees, the feedback interview will save the session ID of their current interview on the server and link it to their feedback issue on github.

Because the \"umbrella\" pattern is not widely used on CourtFormsOnline, this block is not widely used at runtime. It is essentially optional although it is produced in all interviews that are run through the Weaver. It is most useful as a record of what the author intended when the form was run through the Weaver, and is also available for you to make use of in more complex \"umbrella\" interviews of your own. Keep in mind that you may need to make an upstream fix to an interview to fix the interview_metadata because it is not likely the upstream author kept this up to date with later changes to the interview. Example: interview_metadata['my_interview']['al_weaver_version'] = \"0.82.1\"interview_metadata['interview_i_included_in_this_umbrella_file']['al_weaver_version'] = \"1.6.11\" Common keys: Key Purpose Example al_weaver_version documents the version of the Weaver the form was created with 0.82 generated on documents the date the interview was created with the Weaver 2021-05-28 title The title of the form 209a 258e motion for impoundment short title A shorter version of the title, appropriate for smaller windows Impoundment motion description Narrative description Use this motion for impoundment in a 209A or 258E restraining order case when you need to keep information on the form private. original_form Link to the original PDF/DOCX form, unfilled (not commonly used) https://mass.gov/my_pdf.pdf allowed courts A list of the courts the case may be filed in.

Errors combining two branches, trouble merging, trouble combining, resolve merge conflicts, fixing merge conflicts between two branches, branches diverged Sometimes when you start to make a pull request, GitHub will tell you that you have a merge conflict. This means that while you were making changes to your branch, changes were also made to the branch you are trying to merge with and they changed the same lines of code. Git will not decide which bits of code to keep where - you have to decide that. These are unavoidable and a pain to deal with. Everyone runs into them now and again and they are tricky to resolve without introducing bugs. tip Ways to reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts: If possible, make the goals of your branches small so that you only make a few changes on a branch before making a pull request with it. Merge pull requests in the order they were made. Avoid editing the same sections of code at the same time. If you are working with collaborators, try to make sure you are working on tasks that do not edit the same lines. You can still make your pull request, but GitHub will prohibit merging. There are two ways GitHub might handle merge conflicts: GitHub allows you to 'resolve' the conflict in GitHub itself by editing the files in GitHub. GitHub is unable to help you resolve the issue (it doesn't offer the option). Either way, the most reliable way to deal with this situation is, unfortunately, to redo your changes on top of the new code: Make the pull request as usual, and use it as a tool. The changes you made will be highlighted in the file comparison tab. In docassemble create a new Project and pull in the other branch (the one you want to merge with).

But if you cannot find a matching label, use the general rules below to add as many custom labels as you need. Labels should be valid Python variable names that start with a letter​ PDF and DOCX labels should also work as valid Python variable names. The basic rule is that Python variable names need to start with a letter and can only contain letters, digits, and the _ underscore character. Some variable names are reserved and have a special meaning inside AssemblyLine interviews. You should not use a variable name on the reserved list. Doing so can lead to hard to track bugs. Variable names are case sensitive - make them all lowercase​ Field names are case sensitive. The convention is to never re-use variable names with different capitalizations to store different things. Stick with all lower case names for fields when possible. Use the Python snake_case format for field labels​ In PDFs, labels should be all one word, lowercase, with multiple words separated by an underscore, the _ character. This convention is called snake_case. Do not use a . symbol or [] inside a PDF field's label. In a DOCX file, you can use the . symbol as well as brackets [] but they have a special meaning. The . separates an object from its attribute, and the [] indicates that you are referencing a list of items. Beginners should avoid these symbols except when instructed to do so for one of the variable names below. Use short but descriptive labels​ Use variable names that are descriptive but also short. Avoid using abbreviations. A good rule of thumb is to spell out acronyms and initialisms for clarity, but to freely remove words other than nouns and verbs to keep the names short. Use a name you would still understand if you read it in a year. About 30 characters is a good limit to the length of a variable name. It's unusual to need more than that. If your variable name is shorter than 5 characters, it might not be descriptive enough. Some suggestions for coming up with custom labels​ There are no hard and fast rules other than the ones listed above, but here are some conventions that may help you: Drop words from the variable name that don't add specific meaning. Filler words like \"a\", \"the\", etc. are almost never needed. Stick with nouns and verbs. Yes/no variables (also called boolean) commonly start with a form of the verb \"to be\" or \"to have\", paired with a noun. E.g., is_attorney or has_notice_to_quit. You can also use other verbs--writes_docassemble or saved_status or wants_copies_returned. Do not include the type of variable in the variable name itself. It is usually redundant and is not a common Python style. Exception: you might add something like _list or _date that is both a type and is descriptive of the variable's real world contents. There are now a number of samples of interviews built with the Assembly Line framework that you can find online. You can get ideas for variable names to use in your interview that match if they apply to the same concepts. When you're stuck, feel free to ask for help! It's a good idea to get a second opinion the first few times you label a document. A fellow programmer may have some good ideas to make your variable names shorter, clearer, or more closely follow programming conventions.","s":"General rules for labels","u":"/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables","h":"#general-rules-for-labels","p":949},{"i":959,"t":"We have identified common fields that exist in most paper court forms: names of people addresses information that identifies the court signatures dates currency figures a pair of yes/no checkboxes docket numbers or court filing numbers We came up with a convention to identify the roles that people may play in relation to your form: The \"user\" of the form: the person who the form is being filed for, making a request or response to the court The \"other_party\" of the form: the person who the user is responding to or suing We have also identified some common names for people that appear across many forms.

The Docassemble and DOCX variable name users[0] is the equivalent of users or users1 in a PDF label. users[1] is the equivalent of user2.

This detailed accounting of money for each job is required on some financial statements, although in many financial statements, just reporting gross and net income is sufficient. For example, an ALItemizedJob can let the user report: Wages at one hourly rate Overtime at a second hourly rate Tips earned during that time period A fixed salary earned for that pay period Union Dues Insurance Taxes If the financial statement only requires \"gross\" and \"net\" income, the ALJobList has a simpler API and may be the preferred way to represent the income in code. Attributes: .to_add {ALItemizedValueDict} Dict of ALItemizedValues that would be added to a job's net total, like wages and tips. .to_subtract {ALItemizedValueDict} Dict of ALItemizedValues that would be subtracted from a net total, like union dues or insurance premiums. .times_per_year {float} A denominator of a year, like 12 for monthly, that represents how frequently the income is earned .is_hourly {bool} (Optional) Whether the value represents a figure that the user earns on an hourly basis, rather than for the full time period .hours_per_period {int} (Optional) If the job is hourly, how many hours the user works per period. .employer {Individual} (Optional) Individual assumed to have a name and, optionally, an address and phone. .source {str} (Optional) The category of this item, like \"public service\". Defaults to \"job\". WARNING - Individual items in .to_add and .to_subtract should not be used directly. They should only be accessed through the filtering methods of this job. Fulfills these requirements: A job can be hourly. Its wages will be calculated with that in mind. Despite an hourly job, some individual items must be calculated using the job's whole period. Some items will have their own periods. In a list of jobs, a developer may need to access full time and part time jobs separately. In a list of jobs, a developer may need to sum all items from one source, such as tips or taxes.

A fairly ad-hoc function; it will check if the object has several attributes (\"tyler_court_code\", \"tyler_code\", or \"name\"), or if it's already a string, it tries to just make a lower case on the string. We strongly recommend that your court object use the \"tyler_court_code\" attribute though.

Useful for getting all of the information about a code after a user has selected it. pretty_display​ def pretty_display(data, tab_depth=0, skip_xml=True, item_name=None) -> str Given an arbitrarily nested JSON structure, print it nicely as markdown. Recursive, for subsequent calls tab_depth increases. Arguments: data - the JSON structure (python dicts, lists, strings and ints) to print tab_depth - how many spaces to add before each new line, to make the markdown correct skip_xml - this function is mostly for printing responses from the EfileProxyServer, which lazily returns XML as JSON.

Note that while this may be useful to filter out interviews that were accidentally started and likely do not need to be resumed, it will also have the side effect of excluding all answer sets from the results.

Designed to return a list of \"answer sets\" and by default clicking a title will trigger an action to load the answers into the current session. This only works as designed when inside an AssemblyLine line interview. exclude_newly_started_sessions should almost always be set to False, because most answer sets are on \"page 1\" (exactly 1 step was taken to copy the answers and the user isn't able to interact with the answer set itself in a way that adds additional steps) nice_interview_title​ def nice_interview_title(answer: Dict[str, str]) -> str Return a human readable version of the interview name.

Caveats so far: only considers straight, normal horizonal lines that don't touch any vertical lines as fields Won't find field inputs as boxes default_line_height: the default height (16 pt), in pixels (at 200 dpi), which is 45 auto_add_fields​ def auto_add_fields(in_pdf_file: Union[str, Path], out_pdf_file: Union[str, Path]) Uses get_possible_fields and set_fields to automatically add new detected fields to an input PDF.

Whitespace will be altered. If preserve_newlines is true, the return value may have newlines, but double newlines and Windows style (\\r\\n) will be replaced with \\n.

If the value is not defined, return empty string. When preserve_newlines is True, the output will be limited to a number of lines, not a number of characters. The max number of lines will be calculated as floor(self.overflow_trigger/input_width). Therefore, it is important that input_width is a divisor of overflow_trigger. Whitespace will be altered.

Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box. Defaults to 80. preserve_newlines bool - Determines whether newlines are preserved in the \"safe\" text. Defaults to False, which means all newlines are removed. This allows more text to appear before being sent to the addendum. _original_value Any - for speed reasons, you can provide the full text and just use this method to determine if the overflow trigger is exceeded. If no _original_value is provided, this method will determine it using the value_if_defined() method. value_if_defined​ def value_if_defined() -> Any Return the value of the field if it is defined, otherwise return an empty string.

Typically there are three: The final version of a document with a signature. E.g., my_doc['final']. The preview version of a document with no signature. E.g., my_doc['preview']. An addendum of a document contained in the attribute addendum. E.g. my_doc.addendum. There is no limit to the number of keys, but the ALDocumentBundle class expects at least a \"final\" key to exist, and the addendum attribute is required if you desire to use PDF documents with text overflow. It is best practice to use exactly the two keys \"final\" and \"preview\" and the attribute \"addendum\". The \"final\" and \"preview\" documents will normally be the same template, but with logic controlling the display of a particular section, such as the signature. Each form that an interview generates should get its own ALDocument object. The \"addendum\" attribute can be handled in a generic object block. Multiple documents can use the same addendum template, with just the case caption varying. ALDocuments are designed to be used contingently as part of ALDocumentBundle objects. Each ALDocument is considered to be \"enabled\" or \"disabled\" for a particular interview user's session. This allows you to always work with a single object representing all of the possible documents an interview can generate, and use encapsulated logic to trigger individual documents inclusion on the final download screen. Attributes: filename str - name used for output PDF title str - display name for the output PDF enabled bool - if this document should be created. See examples. addendum DAFile | DAFileCollection - (optional) an attachment block overflow_fields ALAddendumField - (optional) ALAddendumFieldDict instance. These values will be used to detect and handle overflow. has_addendum bool - (optional) Defaults to False. Set to True if the document could have overflow, like for a PDF template. Notes: The enabled attribute should always be defined by a code block or the objects block, because by default it is considered fresh on each page load. If your interview logic requires that you directly ask the user whether or not to include a document, you can use a single intermediate variable that is posed to the interview user to work around this limitation.
