forms ask for a person's expenses as a proof of hardship or burden. In designing this feature, we tried to reduce the number of questions a user needs to answer while still asking for specific enough expenses. We don't want to burden the user, but also don't want the user forget to list any significant expenses they would have that could prove financial burden. What expenses you want to initially ask about will depend on your community's needs. For example, if your community lives in northern rural areas, they might have alternative heating needs, like wood or oil, and might not immediately associate those costs with standard \"utilities\". If your community is in a flood plain, you might want to include flood insurance as an option.","s":"Guiding Philosophy","u":"/docs/alincome/expenses","h":"#guiding-philosophy","p":1},{"i":7,"t":"If you want to jump right in, check out a live demo of the ALExpense feature. ALExpense is a class that represents an amount that re-occurs periodically, like a monthly utility bill, or weekly grocery expenses. It has a few attributes: expense.value is the actual amount that is reoccurring. For example, someone's rental insurance might always be $50 each month. expense.times_per_year is the number of times each year that this amount occurs. If someone has to pay their landlord twice a month, times_per_year would be 24. This value can also be fractional if need be; an expense that only needs to be paid once every two years would have a times_per_year of 0.5. expense.source is the source, or name, of the expense. Food expenses could have a source of \"food\". expense.display_name is the name of the source that you want to display to the user. This helps with multi-lingual interviews, where you can show the user the name of the expense, but your interview logic can still refer to a single canonical language name. It also helps add or change additional context to the name that you don't want to write out in your interview logic. For example, expense.source could be \"medical insurance\", but expense.display_name could be \"Medical Insurance (including health, dental, and vision)\". You won't be using ALExpense by itself often though; you'll need a list of expenses from the user, which we'll discuss next.","s":"ALExpense","u":"/docs/alincome/expenses","h":"#alexpense","p":1},{"i":9,"t":"Let's make a short interview that just asks for someone's expenses.

You can customize the options shown to the user by including a definition of an expense_terms variable in your interview. Since the default list is pretty long, we'll make it shorter in this tutorial by copying the below variable definition block: # \"!!omap\" makes these terms ordered: # their order here will be their same order when shown to users. variable name: expense_terms data: !!omap - rent: \"Rent\" - mortgage: \"Mortgage\" - food: \"Food\" - utilities: \"Utilities\" - clothing: \"Clothing\" - credit cards: \"Credit Card Payments\" - property tax: \"Property Tax (State and Local)\" - other taxes: \"Other taxes and fees related to your home\" - medical: \"Medical costs (including insurance)\" - transportation: \"Transportation costs\" - other: \"Other\" Here is what this question screen will look like: display_name As mentioned in the previous section, expense_terms provides the ALExpense objects in your ALExpenseList with the values for source and for display_name; everything to the left of the colon on each line is source and everything to the right is the longer display_name. For each expense that the user said they have, there will be one question screen, asking for how often they pay for that expense, and how much they pay. If they selected \"other\", they will also be prompted to enter the name of that expense. If you want to change the options for how often they pay the amount, you can define a times_per_year_list, similarly to the expense_terms above. By default, the list contains \"weekly\", \"once every two weeks\", \"twice per month\", \"monthly\", \"once every 3 months\", \"once every 6 months\", and \"yearly\". For this tutorial, let's make that list a little shorter.

When you run its interview, you will be able to pick a Project from your Playground and run the tests in that Project. Pros (Moving) You don't need to put your package on GitHub to run the tests. Running ALKiln on your server lets you loop through your development cycle faster - edit, test, edit, test. You don't have to go through committing your code to GitHub every time. You can see the output online right away, including images and documents. In GitHub, to see all of the output files, you have to download a zip file. The only thing you can see online in GitHub is the summary report. You can more easily limit your tests to a specific set of tests using tag expressions. You can use tags on GitHub too, it just takes more steps. You can more often avoid the red \"x\" that appears next to failing tests on GitHub. The red \"x\" is a useful piece of information, but it can be uncomfortable. Cons (Moving) You'll miss catching some kinds of mistakes. Specifically, you may add a file to your Playground and forget to commit it to GitHub. Your tests will pass in your Playground, but your interview will break when you or others install it from GitHub. If your server reloads while the tests are running, ALKiln may come to a complete stop and you'll have to start the tests all over again. What ALKiln is doing (Moving) When you run Playground tests, they do the following: ALKiln navigates to the file your tests specifies in the Project you picked. For each test (or Scenario), ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to whatever interview you named in the test in the Project you chose. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test. If one of the Steps fails, ALKiln adds that to the test report and tries to take a picture of the page with the problem. It tries to avoid taking pictures of sensitive information. When the tests are done, the output page will show you all the generated reports, images, and files if it can. It will also give you a link to download some of that in a .zip file.","s":"Testing your Playground Projects","u":"/docs/alkiln/advanced","h":"#testing-your-playground-projects","p":60},{"i":67,"t":"(Moving) These tests run on GitHub, but they still interact with your server and basically do the same things the Playground tests do, you're just not there to see. Pros (Moving) ALKiln on GitHub will test any changes any team member commits. On your server, you only tests your changes. On GitHub, there are ways to schedule tests to run regularly - every week, every day, or whatever schedule you prefer. If packages you depend on change and break your code, those tests will let you know. If you've forgotten to add a file to the package that an interview depends on (like a missing template file), GitHub will catch that. It installs the file fresh in a new Project, so it only has the files that have been committed properly. You can continue editing any files in your Playground while the GitHub tests run because GitHub creates a whole new Project of its own. When running tests on your server, you must avoid editing the Project that ALKiln is testing. You can configure your GitHub \"action\" to do other things, like create GitHub issues whenever tests fail. If your server reloads during the test run, a few individual tests may fail, but ALKiln will still be able to continue and keep trying to run the rest of the tests. That is because the test code is in running from GitHub, so your reload doesn't stop that process. Cons (Moving) To get these set up, you need to create a docassemble API key, a GitHub token, and make GitHub secrets and you may have to update these in the future. The ALKiln test setup interview helps you do these things, but they can still be confusing. Your tests might be more flaky. That means they may fail for reasons that don't have to do with the interviews. For example, if your tests are running while your server is reloading, ALKiln will keep running, so other tests will still have an opportunity to continue, but individual tests may fail even if your code is correct. Your server can reload for many reasons - updating your config, installing a new package, etc. When tests fail meaninglessly, it slows down your development cycle and sometimes people end up turning off the tests instead of dealing with the complexity. What ALKiln is doing (Moving) Whenever you push (or commit) to GitHub, GitHub will run the tests automatically. You can also trigger them manually. ALKiln goes to the testing account you set up on your server and creates a new Project. If you log into that account, you'll be able to see the new Project in the list of projects. It pulls the relevant branch of your package into the Project. For each test (or Scenario), ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to whatever interview you named in the test. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test. If one of the Steps fails, ALKiln adds that to the test report and tries to take a picture of the page with the problem. It tries to avoid taking pictures of sensitive information. When all the tests are done, ALKiln deletes the Project it created. (Moving) You can see the tests running on your repository's GitHub Actions page. (Moving) At the end, you can see a report and logs right in the workflow's \"job\" page or download a .zip file containing the results of the tests to your computer. That .zip file is what GitHub calls an \"artifact\".","s":"Triggering tests on your server from GitHub","u":"/docs/alkiln/advanced","h":"#triggering-tests-on-your-server-from-github","p":60},{"i":69,"t":"(Moving) These tests also run on GitHub, but they create a new docassemble server on GitHub itself and interact with that. They never touch your server. Pros (Moving) This is the most secure of all the methods. The tests don't interact with your server at all. Since the other tests should be running on a test server, not a production server, this shouldn't be a big advantage, but still - the tests have less chance of accidentally exposing the information of other users on that server. All the advantages listed above for the other type of GitHub tests except this improvement: Your tests will generally be less flaky. When a test fails it's more likely to be a problem with your code instead of a problem with the server. That's because the server is isolated on GitHub and no one is going to make that isolated server reload in the middle of the tests. You don't have to set up or update any docassemble API keys or GitHub tokens. Cons (Moving) Tests take about 5 minutes longer since they have to do things like create a docker container and start a server. The GitHub server installs the latest version of docassemble, which might be a different version than the one you use on your server. Allowing authors to install specific versions would take longer to run. We're still considering if this is a feature we should create. We would appreciate feedback. Regardless of that, whatever server GitHub generates probably won't have the exact same setup as your server, so some interviews may not have the same behavior. You have to be more diligent about including all the \"Dependencies\" that your package needs on your interview's \"Packages\" page. If you don't, they won't be installed with your package on this fresh server. What ALKiln is doing (Moving) Like the other GitHub test method, whenever you push (or commit) to GitHub, GitHub will run the tests automatically. You can run these manually as well. ALKiln creates a fresh docker container and docassemble server in GitHub itself. If you have given ALKiln a docassemble config, it uses that config. It tries to get the log for that process and saves it as an artifact on your GitHub action's summary page. It installs the interview as a package directly on the server. ALKiln does the same things we described above, creating the same GitHub artifacts. When all the tests are done, GitHub destroys the server that ALKiln created. tip (Deleted because users never get to it) If you do run both the GitHub-triggered tests and the GitHub isolated server tests, you'll get the fastest results possible. That is, if all goes well, the GitHub-triggered tests might end first and pass. If they don't and the problem is just with your server, the GitHub isolated server tests might complete sooner. If your server is fine, the GitHub-triggered tests will again finish faster. You'll get the fastest results possible.

It would help a lot to be familiar with GitHub and GitHub actions. You'll need a GitHub repository or organization admin to do one of these steps. You'll need to set this up for each repo running ALKiln tests. Go through the same steps as for GitHub-triggered tests above. Make a new branch on the same GitHub repo. A repo or org admin should create a GitHub secret called CONFIG_CONTENTS. For its value, the admin should copy and paste your testing server's config. Using your production server's config is a security risk. No one will be able to see these values after you leave the secret's page, not even the person who made it. Note, whenever you change the server's config, you'll want to update CONFIG_CONTENTS. Leave your other workflow secrets alone. Note, your DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY and SERVER_URL do not need to be on the same server as your CONFIG_CONTENTS. Make a new workflow file so that it is similar to ALKiln's own workflow file. If you want to stop old tests from running, delete your old workflow file. Read the notes in that file to see what you need to change to adapt the file for your project. Each of the notes is marked with #### Developer note. Commit the changes. See that the tests pass. Make a pull request to your default branch (probably main) to review the code and merge it in. warning (Moving) To use this method, avoid using hard-coded urls to go to a test interview. That is, avoid using https://my-server.com to navigate to interviews or other server pages. That will send the tests to your server.

The items in the table are a snapshot of the user who is filling out the form for that test. Example: And I get to the question id \"has sink\" with this data: | var | value | trigger | | last_haircut_date | today - 730 | last_haircut_date | | wants_virtual_haircut | True | last_haircut_date | | user_name | Beth | user_name | | intro_screen_accepts_terms | True | intro_screen_accepts_terms | The row with | var | value | trigger | is required. How it works: You tell the Story Table Step what question you want to get to. You also make a table of the variables and values the test will need to fill in on its way to that page. Whenever the test gets to a page, it checks your Story Table for any variable names in the table that match a variable name on the page. When the test finds a match, it sets the field to the corresponding value. When the test is done filling in fields on a page, it continues to the next page and repeats until it reaches that question id you gave. As you can see in the example, the order of the items doesn't matter. The test will fill in the fields no matter what order they come in. You will be able to make simple edits to the interview without needing to update your tests. For example, you can move pages around or even move fields to different pages. It also doesn't matter if you include extra items accidentally, though you might want to check the test reports to make sure no necessary fields went unused. You can write a Story Table that goes all the way through your interview, or a Story Table that only goes part way.

If you're testing a \"boundary\" date, you want to pick a date that is well within a boundary to make the test more robust. For example, if you want to test a date that was 10 or fewer days ago, use today - 9 instead of today - 10. At some point your tests might run over midnight. In that situation, if you used 10 the clock would tip into the next day - 11 days from the filled-in date. Your test would fail incorrectly. In fact, your users might have that experience, so design your interview with that in mind. For example, you can tell them the date of the deadline so they too will know about the boundary.

The situations that need this are pretty rare, but here's an example: You navigate to a new page and set a field. Sometimes the test passes, but sometimes the test says an element on this page does not exist. The problem is probably that the page sometimes needs an extra few seconds to load.

It means docassemble tried to get the value for a variable, but could not find where you defined the variable anywhere in your code or in the code you included or imported. Possible causes: It may be that you have not defined a variable in your interview or that you have not defined it in a way that docassemble can find it. That can be for many reasons. For example, maybe you are using an index variable or a generic object incorrectly or maybe you accidentally deleted the block where you were defining the variable. It may be that you have a typo either where you use the variable or where you define the variable. The typo may be in the value instead. It may be that you have a typo in a variable name or value in your test. It may be that you are setting the value incorrectly in your test. Checkboxes are especially complex fields to set.

You might have a simple typo or you might have a perfectly normal misunderstanding of how to write variable names and values. You can check your test code for incorrect variable or value names in a few different ways. If you give every question in your interview an id, the report can help show you where the test failed or where ALKiln skipped setting variables. For each test, the report often has a list of question ids. For each question id, the report has a list of variables that ALKiln set on the page that had the error. If the test failed, you can see what question id the test got to. You can also check previous questions to see what variables are missing from each of those pages - what fields ALKiln skipped. It is more annoying, but in most cases1 you can copy the variable name from your test and search for it in your interview code. You can do the same for values of multiple choice questions. Alternatively, in most cases1 you can go through the interview manually, but follow this procedure: For every single page (even if you think this page has nothing to do with the problem), click on the </> in the nav bar to see the source of the page. Copy the name of the variable from your test and search for it on the page of the running interview. For multiple choice questions, do the same for the value. Use those values to answer the questions exactly as the test would answer them. Continue doing this till you find the problem. If you are unable to find the name of the variable or value in any other way, our last suggestion is the hardest to do, but most reliable - run the interview manually and inspect each page's HTML to find exact names. This is complex and we are happy to show you how to do this. Here is a refresher: Go to a new page. Click on the </> in the nav bar to see the source of the page. For every field in the page: If you cannot see the variable name or value, like for an object_checkbox field or a field created with code: Open the browser development tools. Examine the DOM of a field to find the encoded name of the variable. Use atob('the encoded name or id') with the encoded name or id to fully decode every part of the variable name. You may have to decode multiple times. From those decoded values, put together the variable name that you need to use. Copy the variable name and use your editor to search for that exact variable name in your test file. The variable name is the fully decoded and reconstructed variable name. In the final variable name, replace x, i, j, etc. with their actual values on that page. If the field is a multiple choice field like radio buttons, do the same for the value and use your editor to search for that exact value in your test file. Make sure it appears along with the correct variable name. For a checkbox field, the value is either True or False. Set the value exactly as the test would have set it.

If it looks like the phrase is actually there, a diff checker can be your best friend. Use a diff checker like https://www.diffchecker.com/text-compare/ to copy/paste both the page's text and your test's text to check for differences. If the tool shows you differences, you can copy/paste the page's text into your test.

There are several possible reasons for this. For this type of error, it can be especially useful to look at the console logs and error messages. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for any test: You might have a gherkin syntax error somewhere in your test files. If this was the case, the setup should have completed and the test run should have started, but immediately failed. Find and fix that syntax error. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for GitHub+You™ tests: Your test server was unavailable. If this was the case, your GitHub job logs should show that the test setup failed. Check if the server is running now and run the tests again. Your docassemble developer account credentials were invalid. That is, the API key you created for the docassemble testing account and put in the DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY GitHub input may no longer exist. Maybe the API key got deleted in a docassemble server update. Maybe someone else changed it. You should create a new API key for that testing account and change the value of your DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY secret to the new value. You could also create a new testing account and create a new API key for the new account. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for GitHub Sandbox™ tests: The Docker container or the docassemble server installation is having trouble starting up. If this is the case, your GitHub job logs should show that the docker build step failed. This is a complex problem and takes experience with creating docassemble servers and maybe Docker. You can set the ALKiln SHOW_DOCKER_OUTPUT configuration input to \"true\" to show you more information about what is going on during that setup process. If you have experience with actions and the command line, you might also be able to use the tmate action to explore more about what is going on in your Docker container. Possible reasons for missing artifacts for GitHub+You™ and GitHub Sandbox™ tests: The package manager that installs ALKiln had a problem. This does happen every now and then. If this was the case, your GitHub job logs should show test setup failure. You can check its status, but the problem would have to be happening for a lot of people at once for it to show up.

First, there are reasons even passing tests can be slow, including: Your pages may just be taking a long time to load. This might happen if you are building a large document, uploading a large document, or for other reasons. That can even cause the tests to fail if it takes too long. You can use the \"max seconds\" Step to give them more time. There are some things you can do to speed up some kinds of processes on your server, but that is out of scope for this document. Downloading a lot of documents can take a while. Right now, ALKiln is unable to tell when a document is done downloading, so it gives every document the maximum time possible. By default, that is a full 60 seconds. You can decrease that time with the \"max seconds\" Step, but that time might be too short for the documents to download. You can experiment a bit. You can also be tricky with the \"max seconds\" Step, though, and increase and decrease the value at appropriate times to improve both speed and downloading. If your server reloads a lot during GitHub+You™ tests, it will take longer for tests to finish because the tests try to wait for the server to be available to avoid \"flaky\" tests. Your server can reload for many reasons. For example, saving your config file, saving a python module, or pulling a package that uses a python module can all cause your server to reload. This might even cause your tests to fail. There are also some different reasons that tests get slower when they fail, including: Each failing test gets re-run once, so that can double the amount of time that tests take. Currently, there is no way to choose whether to re-run tests or not. When a Story Table is trying to reach a target page and gets stuck somewhere, it will wait the maximum seconds allowed for a page load (which you can change) to let the interview continue to the next page. By default, that is 30 seconds.

There can be many causes for flaky tests. For example: Your server reloading during GitHub+You™ tests could make it impossible for your tests to reach your interview webpage. You just have to re-run those tests. A slow-loading interview page might make ALKiln think your server is unavailable. That can happen for different reasons. For example, a large document might be taking a long time to load. You might be able to avoid this failure by increasing the maximum wait time with the \"max seconds\" Step. That can make tests slower. You can be tricky about it, though. If you just increase that value for one Step and then reduce it again, that can avoid slowing down your tests too much. Tapping on an element might show content and move other elements around. ALKiln might fail to click on the elements that are moving. You can use the \"wait\" Step to give elements more time to finish moving. Third-party services, like GitHub or package managers, that the tests rely on do have problems every now and then. You just have to re-run those tests. An interview page rendering slowly can hide a field that ALKiln is trying to fill in. If we find that there is a particular type of field that is particularly slow to load, we can slow down ALKiln for that type of field, but that is the most ALKiln can do.

Instead, use ALKiln's account or a completely separate fake account. Never use a database with real information with your tests, even old information. For example: Never share data between your production server and your testing server. For example, if your production server uses a Google spreadsheet to store some user or server data, create a separate Google spreadsheet with fake data for your testing server. Never use old databases. Some projects realize that they should avoid using their current user database for testing. Instead, they decide to use an old database. Avoid that as well.

That is called \"freezing\" the version. Then, when you are ready, you can look at what has changed and decide which version you want to update to. By default, ALKiln runs your tests with its latest version. This means you have all the latest bug fixes and new features. Some organizations choose to use a version that has code and behavior that is familiar and comfortable for them. ALKiln is actually made of 2 parts. One part is the ALKiln framework, which lets you control the robot that goes to your interview and fills in answers. Another part of ALKiln is its GitHub actions, which manage setting up, starting, and cleaning up the tests. Because of factors out of our control, each of these parts has a different way to set the version. To freeze the framework, you need to use the semantic version number. For example, \"5.8.0\". To freeze the actions, you need to use the 40-character git commit id. Both of those need to point to the same5 code. For example, the semantic version \"5.8.0\" of the ALKiln framework should be paired with the git commit with the id e79eb61cb97603d41375134d505e4fe60de7780d that controls the actions. To freeze your version: Find the semantic version that you want. Look at the \"git blame\" for our package.json. Find the 3rd line. It should be the line that shows ALKiln's version. To see the previous version, you can tap on this symbol: Go back in history by tapping on that symbol until you find the version you are looking for. For example, 5.8.0. Find the matching commit id. Tap on the commit message for that line. In the address bar of your web browser, look for a 40-character long set of random letters and numbers. The whole address might look something like this: https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln/commit/e79eb61cb97603d41375134d505e4fe60de7780d. In that example url, the commit id (or SHA4) is e79eb61cb97603d41375134d505e4fe60de7780d. Set both versions. Find your workflow file. Tap to edit the file.

For example, a29519914ffc235802be9b9b143d78ffc3a06028. Add a line below DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY. The indentation level should be the same as DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY.

If you prefer more control over building the theme, you can create a custom theme from the bootstrap source code. The Bootstrap documentation covers the details of theming if you want to take this approach. Create a new custom.scss file anywhere on your computer to contain the SASS/CSS styles for your branding. Detailed instructions on what this file can contain are in the Bootstrap documentation. You can use a color theme generator like Huemint.com to make sure that you have a consistent set of all 9 Bootstrap variables. When you use the color theme generator, at the bottom of the page, you will see a small snippet of code that you can copy into the customs.scss file. For example, your new custom.scss might look like this: // Custom.scss // Option A: Include all of Bootstrap // Include any default variable overrides here (though functions won't be available) $white: #ffffff; $theme-colors: ( \"light\": #d8e2a5, \"dark\": #1b1b1b, \"primary\": #25dec6, \"secondary\": #375b5a, \"info\": #d74d72, \"success\": #0cb545, \"warning\": #f4ca0b, \"danger\": #fa043c, ); // Note: we placed our custom.scss file in the bootstrap path for simplicity, // so we use a different path than in the bootstrap documentation // @import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\"; @import \"bootstrap\"; // Then add additional custom code here Once you have written your custom.scss file, you can use the ALDashboard (which you can install on your docassemble server) to compile a custom Bootstrap theme. If you are associated with the Suffolk LIT Lab and have an account on the Suffolk Development server, you can visit a live version of the tool to try it out. At the end of the tool, you can view what all of the different bootstrap components will look like with your theme. If you want to change any of the colors, you can go back and edit your \"custom.scss\" file and regenerate the bootstrap theme. Once you like the colors you've chosen, download the compiled file, and then add it a docassemble project, in the static folder. You can then reference your new file by adding a bootstrap theme feature to your interview: features: bootstrap theme: my_bootstrap_theme.css Running node and npm to build a Bootstrap config (optional)​ If you don't have access to a docassemble server yourself, you can also compile a bootstrap theme from source using node and npm.

However, you may have very good reasons to collect usage information: Your users might all be inside a single organization rather than consumers You may need to collect anonymous statistics to report to a funder You may be an entity like a court or tribunal and need the information for a legitimate purpose, to serve the user or litigant's needs","s":"Overview","u":"/docs/analytics/tracking_usage","h":"#overview","p":380},{"i":384,"t":"Docassemble has a native integration with both Google Analytics and Segment. Google is widely used and free, but usage is reported to Google and used for purposes of selling advertisements. Segment is a commercial analytics tool with a paid tier. An advantage of Google Analytics and Segment is that the data will be stored for the long term and you do not need to worry about persisting it between server outages or upgrades, nor about retaining information long term on your server. A disadvantage is that they rely on well-known user tracking tools that may be blocked by ad-blocking or other security software, so the usage statistics may not be completely accurate. To use this integration: Make sure each question in your interview has an id. The id specifier will be added automatically to interviews created with the Assembly Line Weaver. Example: id: this is the google or segment analytics id question: | What is your name fields: - Name: user_name Sign up for Google Analytics or Segment, and follow the Docassemble documentation to enable tracking with the system of your choice. This integration allows for very basic tracking. You can identify popular interviews, screens, and dropoff points. Perhaps the most important thing to track is to assign an id named download to your download screen. Then, inside Google Analytics, you can search for the keyword \"download\" under Behavior | Site Content | All pages. Note that the \"page url\" in Google Analytics will have the name of the package and YAML file inserted into the URL. This means you do not need to worry about prefixing the page IDs in order to uniquely track the usage of different interviews installed on your server.","s":"Collecting anonymous analytics with Google or Segment","u":"/docs/analytics/tracking_usage","h":"#collecting-anonymous-analytics-with-google-or-segment","p":380},{"i":386,"t":"By default, every interview created by the Weaver includes this line in a mandatory code block: store_variables_snapshot({\"zip\": users[0].address.zip}) This code runs immediately before the download screen, providing a good proxy of completed interviews. It stores the user's zip code in the Docassemble datatabase, and can be used to run reports about anonymous usage. You can choose to narrow or expand the data that is captured with this tool. The default stores only the zip code, but if you remove all parameters, the user's full interview session will be captured in a simplified state. You can also manually add additional interview variables that you want to store. For example, if you wanted to store the user's city and the list of options they chose for a checkbox variable named user_preference: store_variables_snapshot({ \"zip\": users[0].address.zip, \"city\": users[0].address.city, \"user_preference\": user_preference.true_values() }) Docassemble interviews can store complex nested objects that don't fit neatly in a spreadsheet. If you want to manipulate the data later, you may want to \"flatten\" the data so that it is a neat linear list of fields. That will make later analysis easier. You may also want to adjust the time that the data is stored. If you add the parameter persistent=True, the data will persist even if the user's session is deleted, which may happen every 90 days in a default Docassemble server environment.

These are covered in more depth in the documentation for DAList, although it may be hard to find the specific functions on that fairly long documentation page without internal anchors. The best solution to learn more may be to read about the method on this page, then visit the DAList documentation page and search within the page for the appropriate keyword with command/control+f. Be careful with grammar shortcuts if the interview will be translated These functions help you write short, readable code, but they result in text \"fragments\". In languages that have a different order of verbs, subjects, and objects, this can result in nonsense. It's usually best to use a condition at the whole paragraph level if your text will be translated. It's often safe to use the grammar shortcuts inside a template (because it will be single language), and best to avoid them inside the interview itself.","s":"Dynamic phrasing based on values (gender, list length, and more)","u":"/docs/authoring/dynamic_phrasing_based_on_values","h":"","p":409},{"i":412,"t":"By default, Docassemble abbreviates an individual's middle name, so John Quincy Adams is printed as John Q Adams.

A convenient shorthand for this is the .familiar() method. If you have a list of people in an ALPeopleList, you can use .familiar() on the list, as well as .familiar_or(). For example, if you have an ALPeopleList with \"John Adams\" and \"Jane Smith\": {{ users[0].familiar() }} {{ users.familiar() }} {{ users.familiar_or() }} Results in: John John and Jane John or Jane","s":"Friendly name for a person","u":"/docs/authoring/dynamic_phrasing_based_on_values","h":"#friendly-name-for-a-person","p":409},{"i":416,"t":"If your list is a DAList or a ALPeopleList, referring to the list in the YAML or in your template results in the items all being printed, separated by a comma and with the ending word \"and\", thanks to Docassemble automatically applying the function comma_and_list to the list.

This only works if the list of predefined options is short and the user will expect to find an \"other\" option on the list. fields: - What is your role?: role_name choices: - employee - manager - other - Enter your role: role_other show if: variable: role_name is: other split the combo box into three fields: a dropdown menu with options (like a list of courts inside the user's state), a checkbox that indicates the list doesn't apply, and a fill-in-the-blank text input hidden behind a show if. This is appropriate if the list of options represents the most common selections, and there is an obvious \"mode\" switch. For example, the checkbox might read \"My court is outside of Massachusetts\". fields: - What is your court name?: court_name required: False code: | list_of_courts - My court is outside of Massachusetts: outside_ma datatype: yesno - Enter your court's name: court_outside_ma_name show if: outside_ma if the combo box suggestions are validated by the interview, add some some of those suggestions into examples on the page (which makes them easier to discover for some users) and turn the field into a text input where the validation errors are descriptive.","s":"Avoid comboboxes","u":"/docs/coding_style_guide/accessibility","h":"#avoid-comboboxes","p":455},{"i":472,"t":"Docassemble interviews are written in YAML.

You can generate a first draft for a more complex test with the help of the ALKiln Story Table Step generator. If your interview is using generic objects or index variables, you must include special HTML in your interview. Every time you change or add a required field variable, you must update the tests that need that variable. You write and edit .feature test files in your package's Sources folder. You can check the syntax of your test file by using an editor like the editor at AssertThat. If you are using GitHub+You™ or GitHub Sandbox™ tests, those tests will run when anyone commits to GitHub. By default, each Step or page must be completed in at most 30 seconds. You can change that with the \"max seconds\" Step. ALKiln creates test reports and pictures. For example, ALKiln saves pictures and the HTML of pages that caused errors. In GitHub, those files are in the zip file in your workflow's artifact section. There are some field types that ALKiln cannot yet handle, including some object-type fields. The tests use the gherkin language and syntax.

You can use any names you want. See the \"sign in\" Step for more details. To set up the API key, do the following: Ask an admin on your docassemble server to create an API key for themselves in their user profile2. Use that admin API key to create an API key for your user by using the docassemble API endpoint. If you lose this API key, you can make a new one. You can do that in your terminal or command prompt with this code: $(curl -X POST \\ <your server url>/api/user/<user's email>/api \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \"key\": \"<your admin API key>\", \"name\": \"alkiln_key\", \"method\": \"none\" }') <your server url> is the url of your server in this format: https://your-server-url.org. <user's email> is the email of ALKiln's user account you name in your sign in Step. <your admin API key> is the API key your admin made.

For example: Given the maximum seconds for each Step is 200 And I start the interview at \"favorite_bears.yml\" And the maximum seconds for each Step is 30 You can also increase this setting before you try to download a large file. ALKiln spends twice the value of this setting to download a file. You can read more about the timing in the \"download\" Step. You can use this Step to change the maximum seconds setting at any time in your test. Increasing the maximum time can have down-sides. Some kinds of failures take the maximum amount of time possible. Since each failed test is re-run, those failing tests will take twice the amount of time that you set for your maximum Step time.

Each table row needs one of these in the first column. <value to set> is the value to set for this row's variable name. The table must include all the variables and values necessary to get a user from the current page to the page with the given question id. The table must have two columns with the headings var and value. An example table: And I get to the question id \"brought scissors\" with this data: | var | value | | last_haircut_date | today - 730 | | wants_virtual_haircut | True | | user_name | Jaime | | intro_screen_accepts_terms | True | This Step is flexible, which makes the test easier to maintain. The order of the rows is unimportant. That means you can edit the order of your pages or move fields to different pages without worrying about breaking the test. ALKiln sets a table variable every time it finds that variable on a page, no matter how many times that variable appears in your interview. .there_is_another Avoid using .there_is_another in your Story Table. Read about using .target_number instead. Things to note You can use the Story Table generator to generate a first draft of a full test file. If your interview uses generic objects (x) or index variables (i, j, k, etc), you must have special HTML in your interview to set the values of variables. Right now, Story Tables are unable to use environment variables to fill in answers, so you cannot use them to set sensitive information like passwords. Unused rows The Story Table does not care about extra rows that never get used. This can make Story Tables easier to write, but it also means that the tests will technically \"pass\" even if variables that should get set are never filled in. That can be a sign that a question that the user should have seen got skipped or that there is a typo or mistake in the test. Because of this, the ALKiln report shows a list of unused rows for each table. You can check the report of passing tests to make sure none of the important rows got skipped. How this works, for the curious folks out there On each interview page, ALKiln: Checks if the page has the <target question id> you gave it at the start If the page does have the <target question id> it stops the Step Otherwise, it looks at each <variable name> in the var column to see if it can find that name in any fields For each <variable name> it finds, it tries to answer the field using the matching <value to set> On pages with show if fields, it waits to see if a new field appears If one does appear, it looks through each <variable name> again It sets any value it can and repeats this process When no new fields get revealed, ALKiln tries to continue to the next page If it is unable to continue it logs an error and stops Otherwise, it repeats the above ALKiln sets a table variable every time it finds that variable on any page, no matter how many times that variable appears in your interview.","s":"The Story Table Step","u":"/docs/alkiln/writing","h":"#story-table","p":514},{"i":543,"t":"Use the \"I set\" Step to fill in one value on one page. If your interview uses generic objects (x) or index variables (i, j, k, etc), you must have special HTML in your interview to set the values of variables. The format of the Step: And I set the variable \"<variable name>\" to \"<value>\" There are two types of blanks you need to fill for this Step. The first set of quotes in this Step contain the name of the variable you need to set. The second set of quotes contain the value you want to set. This is the same as the Story Table's's var column and value column. This Step is \"linear\". That is, unlike Story Table rows, these \"linear\" variable-setting Steps have to be in the correct order and you must make sure your test has reached the exact page that has the field. Otherwise your test will fail.

To do that, you can use environment variables with GitHub secrets. If your interview uses generic objects (x) or index variables (i, j, k, etc), you must have special HTML in your interview to set the values of variables. The format of the Step: And I set the variable \"<variable name>\" to the GitHub secret \"<environment variable name>\" Here, <variable name> is the name of the variable you want to set and <environment variable name> is the name of the environment variable that has the value. Example: I set the variable \"user1_account_password\" to the GitHub secret \"ALKILN_USER1_PASSWORD\" A lot of authors use this Step to set answers with sensitive information, like an account number. This is because ALKiln is extra careful with the security of these values. Since workflow environment variables might hold sensitive information, ALKiln avoids taking pictures or downloading the HTML of pages that use environment variables, even when the test has an error on that page. ALKiln avoids printing the value of an environment variable anywhere in the report or in the console log. Not for sign in This Step is unable to sign into your docassemble server.

A variable name is like a kid's name and when the program asks for the value, that's like calling a kid in for dinner. What are environment variables? Environment variables are variables that are available to the whole system - the whole environment the programs are working in. That's like the town where that kid lives and where their house is. That means every test in your test suite can use that variable. You can call that kid in for dinner no matter where in the city they are. Because environment variables are so global, we recommend you start all your environment variable names with \"ALKILN_\" so they have less chance to interfere with your system's other environment variables.

In GitHub, there are different places to put env, so don't worry if you see them in other places in other people's files. You can combine environment variables with GitHub secrets to set sensitive information in your tests. Also, a GitHub organization can combine environment variables with GitHub secrets to get a value to all the test suites in all the organization's repositories. Since workflow environment variables might hold sensitive information, ALKiln avoids taking pictures or downloading the HTML of pages that use environment variables, even when the test has an error on that page.

Not even you can see a secret in GitHub after you create it. In fact, GitHub redacts those values from your workflow logs. You can make secrets for individual GitHub repositories or you can make secrets for your whole GitHub organization. Once you have made the secrets, you might use them in combination with GitHub environment variables and for multiple reasons: Secrets are useful for creating values with sensitive information since no one can see those values. For example, with the \"sign in\" Step. Here is one example of using a secret in a workflow file: # other code env: ALKILN_USER_EMAIL: \"${{ secrets.ALKILN_USER_EMAIL }}\" ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD: \"${{ secrets.ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD }}\" job: # other code Remember to create a separate account for that \"user\". GitHub secrets are useful for sharing values between GitHub organization repositories. All the repositories of a GitHub organization can see its secrets, so you can affect all of those repositories at once from one location. Example situation For example, suppose Mo'nique has a GitHub organization named PolarisLaw. That organization has several repositories. Every test in every repository uses the value \"small_bear\" as an answer to a question. Next month, though, the firm might need to change that value to \"large_bear\". Mo'nique would have to edit that value in every test in every repository. Instead, she makes a GitHub secret in the PolarisLaw account called ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE and sets it to small_bear. Then she uses it in an environment variable she puts in all the workflow files in all the repositories. env: ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE: \"${{ secrets.ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE }}\" She can then use that environment variable in her tests: I set the variable \"bear_size\" to the GitHub secret \"ALKILN_BEAR_SIZE\" Next month, if PolarisLaw needs to change that value, Mo'nique can just edit the value of that secret and change it to large_bear. All the tests will use the new value without her changing anything else. Why not create secrets on your server for ALKilnInThePlayground™ tests?

It works well when the number of items is not important to the user. For example, people usually know the number of children they have. They can count the number of bank accounts or income sources they have, but it's not a number they have in their mind already.

Forward thinking courts have readability targets of 6th grade. But because people don't just read forms--they answer questions and follow instructions--readability isn't a very good measure of form complexity, at least not on its own: Forms use lots of short text (like: Address, Name, and so on), while readability scores are designed to evaluate long narratives. Litigants answer questions and follow instructions on forms as well as reading words. Answers can require getting information from a third party, finding a specific piece of paper (like an ID card), doing math, or making a decision. Answers can be very sensitive, either because they are about private information, like a Social Security Number, or because they evoke a traumatic response, like details of an assault. Answers come in different formats, too. The difference between checking a box and writing out a long answer is significant. Complexity and sensitivity can't always be avoided. For example: a complaint asking for protection from abuse needs to disclose some information about the abuse. But forms should never impose a burden on the litigant that doesn't have a matching benefit.","s":"Why readability scores aren't good enough","u":"/docs/complexity/complexity","h":"#why-readability-scores-arent-good-enough","p":748},{"i":760,"t":"We built the RateMyPDF score by combining feedback from: Form automators Form authors Legal aid experts Court staff And our own in-house experience from building the Document Assembly Line.

You should be able to run the interview now. If this is the first time you're running the interview on the server, you will be asked to log in to eFileIL. If you don't yet have an account, you should be able to make a new pro-se user account with eFileIL by following the links to make a new account on the page. Once you've logged in on the server, subsequent runs of the interview won't ask you to log in, until the eFileIL token expires and you have to log in again, in about 1-2 hours. The next page will ask if you want to search by party name or by case number. For now, let's search by case number. If you select \"case number\", and then enter the case number \"2022SC9\", you should find a case, John Smith vs. Bob Doe, a small claims case. info This case search worked at the time of writing (February 28th, 2023). However, courts have removed older cases from their staging servers before, and it is possible that this search won't work in the future. You can try searching common names like \"John Brown\" or \"John Smith\", or you could ask a court official if they are able to provide you with some testing case numbers from their staging server. We recommend that you build a working relationship with your local courts so they can help you with details like this. You can also go back and search by \"Party name\" instead. You can enter the name \"John Smith\", press continue, and wait. Searching by party name takes longer on eFileIL's server, especially on the staging server, you might have to wait around 30 seconds. Once the search completes, you will see that there are many cases involving John Smith.

The details and case_details attributes aren't stable APIs, but you might find the following attributes useful: court_id, the court that this case came from. Some courts have sub-courts that handle specific case types, so even though you searched for cases in the \"adams\" court, you should use this value for the rest of the interview. participants, an ALPeopleList object that has all of the participants in the case on both sides. each participant has a party_type and party_type_name, i.e. participants[0].party_type_name might be \"Plaintiff/Petitioner\".

This is useful if your interview is only relevant for certain case types. If users don't or can't fill out your form for their case, you can send users to a page that says they don't need this form and why. docket_number has the case number of the court. \"Docket number\" is the term that Massachusetts uses for a unique number assigned to each case by the court.

You may have made a typo or mistake with your variable names, and ended up asking something that is also defined by an Assembly Line question. This could lead to 2 or more very similar questions. You might not have defined something, like the party roles, that your interview now needs to know in order to make sense.","s":"Why is this question getting asked?!!!","u":"/docs/customizing_interview","h":"#why-is-this-question-getting-asked","p":853},{"i":886,"t":"Assembly Line interviews almost always have some questions that come from the \"question library.\" The question library is just a YAML file named ql_baseline.yml. It contains questions about people's names, addresses, birthdates, gender and pronouns, and party roles. You can always write your own version of a question in the library. Docassemble reads your YAML file from top to bottom, so if you add your question that defines the same variables after the include block, Docassemble will always use your version. You maybe shouldn't write your own version. The question library questions are tested by real users. Some customization is to be expected, but be sure you have a clear reason for your choice. Question library questions don't appear in your own YAML file. But you can copy them when your interview is running. Here's how: In the top navigation bar, click the \"source\" button (it looks like </>). Scroll down until you see the question text. Copy it into your own YAML file. Near the other question blocks in your interview is the best place. Add the --- separator at the beginning of the block you copy. Make the changes that you want. About generic object The generic object modifier is a special way to make one question work for many different objects, like people or lists of people. When you customize a question from the question library, you may want to make it specific to one variable in your interview, rather than replace the generic version of the question for any person. To make it specific: Remove the generic object line. Replace x with your variable name. Customize the question and subquestion as needed. For example, suppose your interview asks for a list of guardians. There is no special question about guardians in the question library, so your interview will use the generic object version of the question, which looks like this: --- id: name of the first person sets: - x[0].name.first - x[0].name.last - x[0].name.middle - x[0].name.suffix generic object: ALPeopleList question: | % if hasattr(x, 'ask_number') and x.ask_number and x.target_number == 1: Name of ${ noun_plural(x.object_name(),1) } % else: Name of your first ${ noun_plural(x.object_name(),1) } % endif fields: - code: | x[0].name_fields() Here is a version made specific to guardians: --- id: name of the first person sets: - guardians[0].name.first - guardians[0].name.last - guardians[0].name.middle - guardians[0].name.suffix question: | What is the name of the first person you want to name as guardian? fields: - code: | guardians[0].name_fields() A specific version of a question is always used before the generic object version. About the variable i Just like generic object works for any object, the variable i (and other index variables) lets you write a question for any item in a list. Using a specific number (typically, just the first, or 0th item is treated specially) overrides the one that uses the letter i.","s":"Understanding the question library","u":"/docs/customizing_interview","h":"#understanding-the-question-library","p":853},{"i":888,"t":"Every screen in Docassemble is asked for a reason, and you can always find out why.

When you ran the Weaver, you were asked if the person was the plaintiff, defendant, or could be either. If you answered \"could be either\" your interview will ask for this information. Fix this by customizing the form type. Similarly, you were asked early in the Weaver if there could be one, any number, or at least one for every list of people in your interview.

To keep it simple, the interview will only file one type of case; this lets us hardcode a few pieces of information in our interview. We'll first need to find the right \"codes\" for our interview. Tyler's E-filing system defines specific codes for many different parts of the filing process, include the over-arching category of the case, the more specific case type, and even things like whether or not the filed document should be confidential or not. You will usually need to lookup the case category and the case type. The docassemble integration allows some fuzzy matching based on the name of the case type or category, because codes can change without warning. But in some cases, you will want to specify the exact code. Therefore, you will want to note and enter both the name and the associated code for both case category and case type. https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/ has a fairly complete interface to help you locate codes. But: You might need to write down a code you get at one step to effectively use it as a required parameter or in the endpoint URL in a follow-up search. One common example is the court's name. The court code is often required to be part of the endpoint's path. Court codes are often the same as the court's name, but may have a slight variation. You can look up the court code. Some of the endpoints require that you add a URL parameter. URL parameters follow standard GET rules, with the first parameter needing a ? and each following parameter separated by an &. The value for each parameter follows a =. E.g., ?paramater1=value&parameter2=value Find the jurisdiction and start browsing services and codes​ Locate the jurisdiction you want by visiting https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/. You can click on the URL next to the jurisdiction name to visit the page for that jurisdiction's courts. Find the \"GetCodesService\" link to browse all available codes. For example: https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/. Find the code for a court​ Find the code for the court that you want to file in by visiting the \"GetCourts\" link. It may help to add the parameter ?with_names=true. For example: https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/courts?with_names=true. Note: the available paramaters are documented on the previous page, with the link to each available service. Note the appropriate court code. For example, \"appeals:acsj\" is the code associated with \"Appeals Court - Single Justice (J Docket)\". Find the case category name and code​ Go back to the \"GetCodesService\" link (https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/) and click the example link for the getCategories service. You will need to edit the URL to place the proper court code in the URL. For example: https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/courts/appeals:acsj/categories, where appeals:acsj is the court code. Note the case category's name and code. For example: Case category \"Appeals Court Single Justice - Civil\" has the associated code 8151. Find the code for the case type​ To get the code for a case type, we need to look at the case types available for a specific category associated with a specific court. Visit the getCaseTypes service. Edit the example URL to specify both the court code and a category ID. For example: https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/courts/appeals:acsj/case_types?category_id=8151 Look through the list of codes and pick the appropriate code. For example, for a \"MAC Rule 6.0 – Motion to stay\" the code is 101447. Note that some jurisdictions may use the same case type code for all cases of the same type, across all courts. But at least one jurisdiction, Illinois, uses different codes in different courts. The most recent version of the efiling_integration.yml provided by docassemble-EFSPIntegration allows you to reference the filing code by name to resolve this problem, but some fuzzy matching may be necessary because even the name for the case type can have variations in Illinois. Find the code for the filing type​ In addition to a case type that describes the whole \"envelope\", individual documents inside the case type have their own codes. Use the getFilingTypes endpoint to get a list of available filing types and their associated codes. For example: https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/massachusetts/codes/courts/appeals:acsj/filing_types. You can search in the page for the matching filing type. For example, for \"Rule 6.0 Motion to Stay\" the filing type is 101450. Assuming that your Docassemble interview allows filing exactly one case type and category, the efiling_integration.yml file will expect to find the codes defined this way: code: | efile_case_category_filters = ['Appeals Court Single Justice - Civil', 'Civil'] efile_case_category_default = '8151' efile_case_category_exclude = None efile_case_type_filters = ['Rule 6.0 Motion to Stay'] efile_case_type_default = '101447' efile_case_type_exclude = None The filing type is defined at the bundle level (note you can have as many bundles as you choose in a given interview). #### Complete example -- Illinois single court adoption codes For example, say we want to write an Adoption interview. The codes in Illinois are split by courts, so to see the case categories available to one particular court, say Adams, we can go to [https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/categories](https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/categories), and scroll through the responses until we find the \"Adoption\" entry, code 7306. We would then see the case types for Adoption cases in adams at [https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/case_types?category_id=7306&timing=Initial](https://efile-test.suffolklitlab.org/jurisdictions/illinois/codes/courts/adams/case_types?category_id=7306&timing=Initial), which is 25361. The endpoints should say when they need parameters, like we provided with `category_id=7306&timing=Initial` above. For this guide, we'll stick with a single court, to make things simple to understand. We'll use the following codes: variable name | purpose | example value | example meaning ---------|-----------|-----------|------------- `efile_case_category` | the over arching category of the case | `\"7306\"` | Adoption `efile_case_type` | the specific type of case | `\"25361\"` | Adoption `efile_case_subtype` | optional, if there needs to be more specific case types | N/A | N/A `party_type` | what the role of an individual or party is in the case | `\"7067\"` or `\"20640\"` | Adoptive parent or child `filing_type` | what the filing actually is, usually the name of the document | `\"29730\"` | Application `document_type` | If the document is confidential or not | `\"5766\"` | Non-confidential `filing_component` | If this is the lead document or if it's an attachment | `\"332\"` | Lead document ### Give all of the info that the EFSP needs to file your doc Now that we have all of the codes that we want, we need to define the right variables, setting their values to the codes we found above. Your interview must define the list of `ALIndividual`, `users` and `other_parties`. Each individual should have at least a first name. Note that if only a first name is provided, then the person is assumed to be a business. `users[0]` is almost always the person completing the interview, or at least who the form is being completed on behalf of. For each object in `users` and in `other_parties`, your interview needs to define the following attributes: * `party_type`: this should be the Tyler party type code of that user * `is_new`: if you are filing into an existing case and are adding additional participants to the case, this should be true. They aren't necessary since this interview is making an initial case (where all parties are implicitly new). * `users[0].email` must be defined. Email is not required for any other parties. ```yaml code: | trial_court = 'adams` efile_case_category = '7306' efile_case_type= '25361' --- code: | users[i].name.first if i == 0: users[i].email users[i].party_type = '7067' # adoptive parent users[i].completed = True --- code: | other_parties[i].name.first other_parties[i].party_type = '20640' # adoptive child other_parties[i].completed = True The following variables must also be defined: user_started_case: an Assembly Line variable determining if the users are plaintiffs/petitioners. lead_contact: this is the person who will be contacted about the status of this filing, and can just be set to users[0]. tyler_payment_id: This is the payment information that Tyler needs to collect payment for the filing. It is the string of the payment method ID. We'll deal more with this in the advanced guide (coming soon), but for now, we'll assume that the filer qualifies for a fee waiver, and can use the global waiver payment account, \"global\" meaning that any filer can use when filing. You can get this waiver payment account from the config: get_config('efile proxy', {}).get('global waiver', ''). al_court_bundle should be an ALDocumentBundle, containing all of the documents that you want to file.

The metadata can include things like a case number, the names of parties, and codes that tell a clerk what kind of filing is being delivered. E-filing replaces delivering documents to the court by hand, mail, or courier. Traditionally, e-filing requires visiting a dedicated web page, creating an account, converting documents into PDF format, and then inputting a lot of confusing information, such as document type, filing codes, and court codes. The LIT Lab's primary tool is code that guided interview authors can incorporate to add a simple one-click e-file button into an existing guided interview. The interview author can pre-select or help the litigant select the proper codes. This removes the most challenging part of traditional e-filing. If the litigant qualifies for a fee waiver, they may not even be required to create an account. We have also created a very simple e-filing \"portal\" that works much like traditional e-filing websites. This is not a product we expect end-users to interact with just yet. There are many competing systems of e-filing, but often there is a monopoly vendor within a given jurisdiction. Often, the vendor may have a program that allows third-parties to deliver documents to the vendor. Then, the vendor takes care of delivering the document the rest of the way to the court's docket. If you think of the e-filing vendor as a corporate mail room, then third-party vendors like the Suffolk LIT Lab are the equivalent of UPS or FedEx. We just get the document to the building. The e-filing vendor handles getting it to the right desk. From a court clerk's point of view, the filing looks just like a filing uploaded through the vendor's first-party system.","s":"What is e-filing?","u":"/docs/efiling/overview","h":"#what-is-e-filing","p":922},{"i":929,"t":"The LIT Lab is a certified EFSP, or Electronic Filing Service Provider, for the Tyler Technologies system.

There are additional states that use Tyler as the monopoly vendor but do not have a current EFSP agreement in place. In two states Suffolk LIT Lab has started conversations to be the first participants in a new EFSP program. The LIT Lab also has a bespoke integration with Jefferson Parish's JeffNet, an in-house e-filing tool built for Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.

Interviews request a fee calculation, pass off control to the Tyler Payment Gateway, and then once payment is completed control passes back to the interview. The Suffolk e-filing server also allows filing cases with a fee waiver. Some courts may require that the litigant provide payment information even if they have filed a fee waiver.

If anything is incorrect or doesn't work as expected, feel free to email us at massaccess@suffolk.edu. If you are expecting to file into different courts, a potential complication is that some courts have different codes for the same cases. For example, Peoria county's Adoption code is 7405, and the Adoption case type is 5892. The good news is that most case categories and case types have the same name. You can hardcode the expected name of the case category or case type with the following code block: # court_id can be any IL court, like \"adams\" or \"peoria\". categories = proxy_conn.get_case_categories(court_id, fileable_only=True, timing='Initial') for category in categories: if category['name'] == 'Adoption': tyler_category = category['code'] For things like party types, you'll want to ask the AL questions about roles first, i.e. user_ask_role.

If an address is an ALAddress, it has an address_fields() method that can be used inside a fields: code: | statement to insert a consistently formatted series of address fields. address_fields() will include an autocomplete method and is internationalized. Assembly Line question library questions use ALAddress objects for both the address and mailing_address attributes of people. Example: --- objects: - the_address: ALAddress --- id: address question sets: - the_address.address - the_address.city question: | What is the address? fields: - code: | the_address.address_fields() See Addresses for more information and examples. note You must use sets with the address_fields() method. Otherwise Docassemble will not be able to find the block to provide a definition of the address fields. The address_fields() method includes the following optional parameters: country_code: if provided, will be used to control the list of states that is displayed as well as the default country in the country drop down. In the Assembly Line question library, country_code typically defaults to the value of AL_DEFAULT_COUNTRY default_state: default state, province, or sub locality. In the Assembly Line question library, default_state typically defaults to the value of AL_DEFAULT_STATE show_country: defaults to False. If enabled, a country drop down menu will be displayed. ALAddressList​ The ALAddressList class is a collection of ALAddresses. It is used to allow you to collect multiple addresses in one go and otherwise works exactly like the built-in Docassemble DAList object. The __str__() method of an ALAddressList has been modified so that using it displays a series of addresses on one line, separated by ;. This is used any place that Docassemble treats the variable as text, such as in a template, attachment block, or in a question or subquestion field. Example: ${ person.previous_addresses } might display 123 Main St, Boston, MA; 456 Broadway, Cambridge, MA. The previous_addresses attribute of an ALIndividual is an ALAddressList.","s":"ALAddress and ALAddressList classes","u":"/docs/framework/algeneral","h":"#ALAddress","p":952},{"i":958,"t":"The ALIndividual is an extension of the Docassemble Individual class. It should be used to represent both natural people and businesses or other entities. ALIndividual objects include the following methods that are not in the stock Individual class: signature_if_final(i) is meant to be used inside a template or attachment block with the ALDocument class. It displays the signature if and only if i == 'final'. phone_numbers() displays either mobile_number, phone_number, or both if both are present for use in a PDF form with only one space to list phone numbers. contact_methods() displays a list of the contact methods the user provided in the default question library \"contact information\" screen as a formatted string. Specifically, it will display mobile_number, phone_number, email, and other_contact_method. This may be helpful in a formatted letter. age_in_years() returns the individual's age as an integer (whole number), calculated from the individual's birthdate attribute. formatted_age() is like age_in_years() but returns a formatted string with years, months, weeks, and days included when relevant. The cutoff is 2 weeks to display days, 2 years to display months, and anything over 2 years displays only years. name_fields(person_or_business:str = 'person', show_suffix=True) is like address_fields() and is used to display a list of either 3 or 4 fields for a person's name. See Names address_fields() is a wrapper around the address_fields() method of an ALAddress with the same parameters. gender_fields(show_help=False) is like the address_fields() method but displays a list of vetted gender options. Read more about gender questions. pronoun_fields() displays a question that allows the user to provide their pronouns, with multiple choice and a fill-in-the-blank option. See pronouns. initials() is used to return a string with the 1, 2, or 3 initial letters of a person's name. E.g., QKS for Quinten K Steenhuis. language_fields(choices=List[Dict[str, str]]) provides a language selector that sets the .language attribute of the user, together with an other fill-in. This should be the two-letter ISO language code. We recommend defining and passing a dictionary named al_language_user_choices which will also be used by built-in questions triggered from ql_baseline.yml. language_name() will return the language name in English. If there is a system-wide translation words.yml translation file and the user's interface is in that language, the language name will be translated. If the user selected an other option, the other option will be returned. Read-only attributes: The following are all read-only attributes you can use with PDF checkbox fields. They return True or False depending on the value of the gender attribute. gender_male gender_female gender_nonbinary gender_other (True if and only if the gender attribute is not \"female\" or \"male\") gender_unknown gender_self_described Relation to the Individual class​ The ALIndividual class inherits from Docassemble's Individual class, and all other methods of Individual work the same way as they do in the Individual class. ALPeopleList​ The ALPeopleList class is used to represent a group of people. Otherwise it works exactly like the built-in Docassemble DAList object. It also has the following additional methods: familiar() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with and joining the last two items familiar_or() returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each member of the list, with or joining the last two items short_list(limit:int, truncate_string:str=', et. al.') returns a list that will be cut off at the limit provided. By default, , et. al. is appended.

Relation to the DAList class​ ALPeopleList inherits from Docassemble's DAList class, and retains all methods and attributes of a DAList. Specifically, the language methods, including the pronoun() and related methods, can be used to display the correct pronoun depending on the number and gender of the members of an ALPeopleList. E.g., users.pronoun_possessive() will return her if there is a single user with the gender attribute value \"female\", and their if there are multiple members of the list. These methods can be helpful inside single-language pleading templates but usually should not be used inside the interview itself, as they can make translation challenging. While there are language-specific versions of these methods, they can lead to odd ungrammatical \"fragments\". As tedious as it may be, the best practice for translation inside the interview is to use conditional logic for full sentences matching each gender and number.","s":"ALIndividual and ALPeopleList classes","u":"/docs/framework/algeneral","h":"#ALIndividual","p":952},{"i":960,"t":"Currently, the Assembly Line interviews provide these classes that you can use to target questions to a specific type of person: Tenant HousingAuthority Applicant Abuser Survivor Each class subclasses ALIndividual and shares its methods and attributes.

ALDocumentBundle objects can be nested to allow you to group multiple individual template files into one document that the user can download. Both ALDocument and ALDocumentBundle objects can be either enabled or not.

There are usually exactly two keys in the dictionary: preview and final, with the only difference being the presence or absence of a signature. Conditional logic inside the template or attachment block can be used to show or hide the signature depending on the value of the key so that the template does not need to be created twice. The signature_if_final method of an ALIndividual was created to simplify this common use case. Here's how to use an ALDocument: Create ALDocument objects in an objects block. Set any required attributes, like enabled, in the object block or in a separate code block. If you set enabled=True in the object block, your document will always be enabled. Define the key of the ALDocument in an attachment block using the variable name modifier. Usually, use one attachment block and define the variable name like this: variable name: some_al_document[i]. Optionally, reference the ALDocument inside an ALDocumentBundle. Example: --- objects: - letter: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"ssa_letter\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False) --- attachment: - pdf template file: ssa_letter.pdf variable name: letter[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) }","s":"ALDocument class","u":"/docs/framework/aldocument","h":"#aldocument-class","p":1017},{"i":1023,"t":"If other variables in your interview determine if your document is enabled, you should define the enabled attribute in a code block, like this: --- objects: - main_document: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"main_document\", enabled=True, has_addendum=False) - insurance_rider: ALDocument.using(title=\"Letter to Social Security\", filename=\"rider\", has_addendum=False) --- attachments: - pdf template file: main_document.pdf variable name: main_document[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } - pdf template file: rider.pdf variable name: rider[i] fields: - \"users1_name\": ${ users[0] } - \"users1_signature\": ${ users[0].signature_if_final(i) } --- code: | if total_cost > 1000: insurance_rider.enabled = True else: insurance_rider.enabled = False # or more concise but slightly harder to read: # insurance_rider.enabled = total_cost > 1000 In the example above, the insurance_rider document is only included in any bundles if the total cost of the project is over $1,000. Note that the enabled value is global for the interview session. If you want to use different logic in different bundles, you can easily create a separate ALDocument that references the same template file and attachment block. Attributes: filename: the display filename used for the document when it is downloaded title: the title shown on the download screen enabled: whether the document should be \"turned on\" when it is referenced in an ALDocumentBundle addendum: points to a variable representing an attachment block with a formatted addendum. The Assembly Line provides a good default addendum template that is flexible enough to work with many fields. overflow_fields: an ALAddendumFieldDict with each representing a field that has potential to be sent to the addendum if exceeds a pre-set length. has_addendum: set this to True or False to control whether the overflow_fields dictionary will be checked to decide whether or not to generate an addendum file. Optional; defaults to False. Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a PDF version of the completed template and any addendum. key is normally preview or final as_docx(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a DOCX version of the completed template and any addendum if the original is a DOCX template. key is normally preview or final. as_list(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True): returns a 1 or 2 item list which contains the template and its addendum, if any. need_addendum(): returns True if the addendum exists and there are overflow fields. has_overflow(): returns True if there are fields that trigger the addendum. overflow(): returns a list of just the fields that triggered the addendum. safe_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"safe\" value of field_name (the amount that is less than overflow_trigger) plus an overflow message. Used in an attachment block. overflow_value(field_name:str, overflow_message:str=None, preserve_newlines:bool=False, input_width:int=80): returns the \"unsafe\" value of field_name--the amount that exceeds the overflow_trigger.

Here's how to use an ALDocumentBundle: Create the ALDocumentBundle in an objects block. Add each ALDocument or nested ALDocumentBundle that your interview will sometimes produce to the bundle. Because the list is usually known in advance, it's common to include this in the object definition. Use the as_pdf() method on your preview screen to display a preview of the output without any signature. Use the download_list_html() and send_button_html() methods on your download screen. You can have as many or as few bundles as you would like. The Assembly Line convention is to use the following two bundles: al_user_bundle which should include a next steps document with instructions for your user al_court_bundle which leaves out the instructions and should have every document that you want the clerk to receive Stick with this convention if you expect to integrate with E-filing. Example: --- objects: - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[ssa_next_steps, letter]) - al_court_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(title=\"Forms to download\", filename=\"ssa_documents\", elements=[letter]) note You can nest ALDocumentBundles! Just create your bundle in a separate objects block and add it directly into the list of elements. This lets you create a document from multiple templates that you want the user to be able to open and print as one file. Attributes: enabled (optional): define this if the bundle is included inside another ALDocumentBundle. If other variables in your interview determine if it's enabled, you should define the attribute in a code block, like in this earlier example title: this is displayed on the download screen filename: used to construct the display filename for a pdf version of the bundle Methods: as_pdf(key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> DAFile: return a single concatenated PDF of the bundle's attachments as_zip(self, key:str = 'final', refresh:bool = True, title:str = '') -> DAFile: returns a compressed ZIP archive with separate documents for each item. enabled_documents(self, refresh:bool=True) -> List[Any]: return a list of only the \"enabled\" documents in the bundle as_flat_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: get_titles(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[str]: as_pdf_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: as_editable_list(self, key:str='final', refresh:bool=True) -> List[DAFile]: download_list_html(self, key:str='final', format:str='pdf', view:bool=True refresh:bool=True, include_zip:bool = True, view_label=\"View\", view_icon:str=\"eye\", download_label:str=\"Download\", download_icon:str=\"download\", zip_label:str=None, zip_icon:str=\"file-archive\") -> str: returns HTML for a table with download and view buttons, as for a download screen send_button_html(self, key:str='final', show_editable_checkbox:bool = True)->str: send_email(self, to:any=None, key:str='final', editable:bool=False, template:any=None, **kwargs) -> bool: Example of a download screen that uses an ALDocumentBundle: --- progress: 100 id: download event: petition_to_change_name_of_adult_download question: | Your form is ready to download. subquestion: | Thank you ${ user_name_first_new }.

Use the stock table of contents template as a model. It has some fancy math to figure out what page number to start the exhibits at, based on whether it thinks the table of contents itself will spill onto a second page. You can add your own template for the individual cover pages for each document, too. Use the stock cover page template as a model. By default, exhibits are labeled sequentially as A, B, and so on. You can supply your own method for labeling each exhibit by defining the auto_labeler attribute of the your_document.exhibits object to be a Python function that accepts an integer and returns a string. The default labeler is just the Docassemble function alpha. If, for example, you wanted to use Roman numerals: mandatory: True code: | exhibit_attachment.exhibits.auto_labeler = roman where roman is referring to the Docassemble function. You can also define your own labeling function, like: mandatory: True code: | exhibit_attachment.exhibits.auto_labeler = lambda y: str(y+1) Which would make the exhibit labels 1, 2, and so on.

In some cases, you may want navigation sections to show or hide depending on choices the user makes during the interview. The Assembly Line framework adds an optional method to add dynamic navigation when the enable_al_nav_sections variable is set to True. This feature is disabled by default. Docassemble already has a way to define sections dynamically, with nav.set_sections(). Use the Assembly Line method when your navigation sections are relatively simple. If your needs don't fit well with the Assembly Line's simple declarative approach, you may prefer to use nav.set_sections() directly. The Assembly Line approach can be most helpful when: You know the full list of available sections at the beginning of the process. For example: one section for each optional document or dependent on the user's logged-in status. The total possible number of sections is also known in advance. You can evaluate a True/False expression to decide if a section should be visible.","s":"Dynamic navigation sections","u":"/docs/framework/navigation","h":"","p":1128},{"i":1131,"t":"Add a code block to your interview that looks like this: --- code: | enable_al_nav_sections = True","s":"Turning on the Assembly Line navigation system","u":"/docs/framework/navigation","h":"#turning-on-the-assembly-line-navigation-system","p":1128},{"i":1133,"t":"When enable_al_nav_sections is True, the Assembly Line framework will look for the definition of a list of dictionaries named al_nav_sections on each screen load.

The structure of each dictionary in the list should be the exact same format that is expected by nav.set_sections(), with the addition of one new key, hidden. If hidden is True, the list item will not be shown. You can use docassemble's data from code block as a convenient and easy to read way to create this list: --- reconsider: True variable name: al_nav_sections data from code: - section_intro: | \"Introduction\" - section_about_you: | \"About you\" - section_about_spouse: | \"About your spouse\" hidden: not showifdef(\"is_married\")","s":"Defining the list of available sections","u":"/docs/framework/navigation","h":"#defining-the-list-of-available-sections","p":1128},{"i":1135,"t":"When you use data from code, the labels need to be defined as literal Python strings (which is why they follow the vertical pipe symbol, | on their own lines).

And you would need to define al_nav_sections itself in a separate code block. Here is an example: question: | How many rooms are in your house? fields: - Room count: room_count - Do you want the optional section to show?: show_optional datatype: yesno --- variable name: my_always_defined_nav_sections data: - section_name: Section Name hidden: False - \"top level item\" - section_about: About You hidden: False - section_opt: Optional section hidden: ${ not showifdef(\"show_optional\") } --- reconsider: True code: | reconsider(\"my_always_defined_nav_sections\") if defined(\"room_count\"): tmp_sections = [] for n in range(room_count): tmp_sections.append({f\"room_{n+1}\": f\"Room {n+1}\"}) al_nav_sections = my_always_defined_nav_sections + tmp_sections del tmp_sections else: al_nav_sections = my_always_defined_nav_sections","s":"Adding an unknown (dynamic) number of sections","u":"/docs/framework/navigation","h":"#adding-an-unknown-dynamic-number-of-sections","p":1128},{"i":1145,"t":"A simple way to keep the list of sections fresh is to add the reconsider: True modifier to the block that defines the sections. We use this in the examples. It should be fine for most real-world interviews. If your interview is already bit slow, note that using reconsider: True can add a small slowdown to every page load. One alternative to avoid this slowdown is to list all of the variables that can invalidate the current menu's accuracy with the depends on modifier. This is a fine tradeoff (adds a tiny bit of maintenance), and it works for most scenarios. As an example of where it won't be sufficient: depends on will not trigger an update when the items in a list change. If depends on is not enough, you could still save a little page load time by explicitly triggering the navigation to be rereshed at defined points in the interview flow. This works well when you have a linear interview and don't allow editing the answer to questions that could change the navigation. Even if you do have this issues, you could force reloading the definition of al_navigation_sections in the \"edit\" button. To set up this more manual refreshing, you'll want to do this in a separate code block, not directly in the interview order block. You need to reconsider the navigation before using nav.set_section(). For example: --- code: | reconsider(\"al_nav_sections\") reconsider_nav_once = True --- code: | reconsider(\"al_nav_sections\") reconsider_nav_twice = True --- ###################### Main order ####################### mandatory: True code: | nav.set_section(\"section_documents\") doc_list reconsider_nav_once ... reconsider_nav_twice if some_condition: nav.set_section(\"newly_visible_section\")","s":"Keeping the navigation menu fresh: warnings","u":"/docs/framework/navigation","h":"#keeping-the-navigation-menu-fresh-warnings","p":1128},{"i":1147,"t":"This example uses the data from code method --- include: - docassemble.AssemblyLine:assembly_line.yml --- code: | enable_al_nav_sections = True --- reconsider: True variable name: al_nav_sections data from code: - section_intro: | \"Introduction\" - section_about_you: | \"About you\" - section_about_spouse: | \"About your spouse\" hidden: not showifdef(\"is_married\") --- mandatory: True question: | Are you married? yesno: is_married --- mandatory: True question: | Thanks for letting us know!","s":"A complete example","u":"/docs/framework/navigation","h":"#a-complete-example","p":1128},{"i":1150,"t":"A reserved variable name is a variable name that already has a predefined meaning.

It is usually better to ask for goals (\"Do you need the attorney's ID number?\"), not details (\"Do you want the ID number field to show up right under the attorney's name field?\"). Remember: if you ask a question you will get an answer. If you don't need an answer, asking for one is not likely to help and may complicate the project.

Commit to the branch as you edit, and then when you are finished making your changes, create a pull request to merge this branch into the branch called main. As a general rule, avoid editing the branch called main, the default branch. Only update main with pull requests from other branches. As another general rule, avoid creating branches from branches other than main—this is a recipe for merge conflicts. When naming branches or writing commit messages or pull request titles, it is helpful to describe the change(s) they relate to. Branch names are usually short. They are a description of the purpose of the changes you will make—a description that you or your teammates can understand at a glance. While you are working on a branch, commit early and often, and use the commit message to describe the change you just made to the interview code. Pull request titles should be a summary of the purpose of your changes. They are usually more detailed than the branch name. Pull request descriptions should provide context, mention related issues, and generally explain the reason for the change. Examples of a good branch name, commit messages, and pull request title: Branch name: 2024_court_form_updates Commit messages: Update cash income question Fix broken address field Update e-filing codes Update interview version Pull request title: Updates the interview for the new 2024 court form That way, when you look at the list of commits, pull requests, or branches you can more easily reconstruct the work you did (or in the case or branches, intended to do).

One of three things is probably going on. You have technically not made any changes to the code that is actually being pushed to GitHub. You lack permissions for the repository you are trying to commit to. There is a merge conflict to resolve. Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the details of the error. These are a step-by-step log of what is happening in git, the version-control system GitHub uses. The most recent message is at the bottom. (Ignore the line talking about a Detached head. That is actually a natural intermediate part of the process, not a problem.) Here are details about the three problems above, how you can identify them, and possible solutions. If You See nothing to commit, working tree clean​ This means git cannot detect any changes in your code. You cannot commit anything from docassemble if you have not made changes—not even to a new branch. These are some possibilities: If you created a new file you may have not added it to your playground package. Select Folder / Packages and scroll down to the Interview files and Template files sections. Use Command (⌘)+click on a Mac and Ctrl+click on Windows to select the files you want to commit to the repository. You may not have saved changes to a file. If the file is still open you can click the Save button. If the file is closed you will have to open it and make the changes again. You may not actually have made any changes to the files even though you thought you did. If You See 403​ A 403 error means you do not have write permission for the repository. Ask the person or organization that owns it to give you permission or add you to a team that has permission. If you are trying to make a new repository on your GitHub account, you may belong to an organization that already has a repository with the same name. You will either have to change the name, have the organization delete its repository, or get permission to write to the existing repository. If you think your GitHub account does have permission, try redoing the GitHub integration. If You See CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict​ The text CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict means the branch you are trying to push to changed while you were making your changes. It is what a merge conflict looks like in docassemble in git. Simply make a new branch and commit the changes there.

But if you cannot find a matching label, use the general rules below to add as many custom labels as you need. Labels should be valid Python variable names that start with a letter​ PDF and DOCX labels should also work as valid Python variable names. The basic rule is that Python variable names need to start with a letter and can only contain letters, digits, and the _ underscore character. Some variable names are reserved and have a special meaning inside AssemblyLine interviews. You should not use a variable name on the reserved list. Doing so can lead to hard to track bugs. Variable names are case sensitive - make them all lowercase​ Field names are case sensitive. The convention is to never re-use variable names with different capitalizations to store different things. Stick with all lower case names for fields when possible. Use the Python snake_case format for field labels​ In PDFs, labels should be all one word, lowercase, with multiple words separated by an underscore, the _ character. This convention is called snake_case. Do not use a . symbol or [] inside a PDF field's label. In a DOCX file, you can use the . symbol as well as brackets [] but they have a special meaning. The . separates an object from its attribute, and the [] indicates that you are referencing a list of items. Beginners should avoid these symbols except when instructed to do so for one of the variable names below. Use short but descriptive labels​ Use variable names that are descriptive but also short. Avoid using abbreviations. A good rule of thumb is to spell out acronyms and initialisms for clarity, but to freely remove words other than nouns and verbs to keep the names short. Use a name you would still understand if you read it in a year. About 30 characters is a good limit to the length of a variable name. It's unusual to need more than that. If your variable name is shorter than 5 characters, it might not be descriptive enough. Some suggestions for coming up with custom labels​ There are no hard and fast rules other than the ones listed above, but here are some conventions that may help you: Drop words from the variable name that don't add specific meaning. Filler words like \"a\", \"the\", etc. are almost never needed. Stick with nouns and verbs. Yes/no variables (also called boolean) commonly start with a form of the verb \"to be\" or \"to have\", paired with a noun. E.g., is_attorney or has_notice_to_quit. You can also use other verbs--writes_docassemble or saved_status or wants_copies_returned. Do not include the type of variable in the variable name itself. It is usually redundant and is not a common Python style. Exception: you might add something like _list or _date that is both a type and is descriptive of the variable's real world contents. There are now a number of samples of interviews built with the Assembly Line framework that you can find online. You can get ideas for variable names to use in your interview that match if they apply to the same concepts. When you're stuck, feel free to ask for help! It's a good idea to get a second opinion the first few times you label a document. A fellow programmer may have some good ideas to make your variable names shorter, clearer, or more closely follow programming conventions.","s":"General rules for labels","u":"/docs/label_variables","h":"#general-rules-for-labels","p":1393},{"i":1403,"t":"We have identified common fields that exist in most paper court forms: names of people addresses information that identifies the court signatures dates currency figures a pair of yes/no checkboxes docket numbers or court filing numbers We came up with a convention to identify the roles that people may play in relation to your form: The \"user\" of the form: the person who the form is being filed for, making a request or response to the court The \"other_party\" of the form: the person who the user is responding to or suing We have also identified some common names for people that appear across many forms.

Goals Stability: Maria’s primary goal is to provide a stable home for her children. She wants to avoid eviction to maintain access to her children’s school and her local support network. Education: She is keen to learn more about her rights as a tenant and how she can legally contest an unfair eviction. Assistance: Maria needs easy-to-understand, accessible legal advice and support that fits into her limited budget and time constraints. How sophisticated does the automation need to be?​ Look over the Legal app maturity model. What level form will be your target for this project? Keep in mind both the sophistication of your user, available time and budget constraints, and any safety concerns. For a tool aimed at legal professionals, a level 1.5 or level 2 form is usually enough. For a tool aimed at the general public, a level 2 is usually the minimum. Targeting level 3 or 4 is always tempting, but depending on constraints may not be justified by the increased time and cost. You should release a first draft at the earliest safe stage, and then continue refining only as long as appropriate based on the needs of the end user for this particular project.","s":"Understanding the project's users and intended purpose","u":"/docs/get_started/working_with_teams","h":"#understanding-the-projects-users-and-intended-purpose","p":1439},{"i":1452,"t":"Come up with a rough schedule with key milestones. When coming up with a project timeline, think about both resources and the project's size. Resource constraints include: Available working hours (a typical developer has 25 productive hours in a week, while a student can allocate about 1/2 of their credit hour expectations to development and may also take 3-5 times as long as an experienced developer at the same tasks) Other ongoing projects Delivering early and frequent work to the client for review and feedback Complexity is affected by: The number of formatted pages (static pages without fields or logic don't add to complexity) Expected precision and fidelity Complexity of formatting for lists, headings, names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. Whether language must be made dynamic to account for quantity, pronouns, and relationships How flexible pagination will be in the output document depending on the amount of optional text or the quantities of people (such as children, agents, etc.) Number of fields The complexity of the fields and responses possible for each field The number of branching logic points (often caused by conditional language or documents in the output) The kind of output documents that are expected: Multiple sets, in different combinations, for different quantities of people? With addenda or other ancillary documents that need to be created from scratch? For a project involving one form, the first milestone should be a working draft of the tool that completes every question, even if it is in a very rough order. Set a deadline for this. With the help of the Weaver, it should be possible to reach this in 10-15 hours for even a quite long form. Be willing to postpone certain features to hit this first milestone. You'll need to communicate very clearly with the client that this rough prototype is not even close to the final product but that you still need their high level feedback on it. For a project involving multiple forms, we recommend: Starting with the simplest form to get the client's early feedback Moving on to the most complex form to confirm the shape and logic of the whole process with your client Then continuing with the remaining forms Sample timeline for a project with 12 forms of varied complexity Each phase is scheduled for 2 weeks-2 months: Phase 1, 2 weeks: Completion of a draft of 1 key document, which may include a subset of the full functionality, in order to obtain the client's input and review. The decisions that come out of this first document will guide completion of the remaining 11 documents. Phase 2: Completion of drafts of up to 6 of the remaining documents. Coordination of usability tests to identify changes that should apply to the remaining documents. Phase 3: Completion of the full document set. Some functionality may be in a rough draft or ommitted for this stage. Phase 4: All functionality is implemented. client to review and offer suggestions. Coordinate for second round of usability testing and feedback. Final phase: based on the final feedback and proposed changes, complete all remaining work.

How will we know if the project is successful? Time How much time does the process take now? What time savings (per use) is enough to justify the project? People helped How many people need the solution your tool helps with? For example: About 10,000 people are brought to eviction court in Massachusetts each year. How many people would be enough to reach? 10%? 30%? More? For example: helping 2,000 of the 10,000 people who are evicted represents a significant percentage of the whole even though it is a relatively small absolute number. Closing an access gap Who is not appropriate to complete the process now due to lack of training or legal specific expertise, but can be after your tool exists? For example: will your tool allow a social worker to complete the process, whereas before it required a lawyer or paralegal? Who can't easily participate in the process now, due to language, reading grade level, complexity, or other barriers? How will your tool reduce or eliminate these barriers? Think in advance how you will measure success on these criteria. You can use the Interview Stats package to track usage. Usability tests, reading grade level measurements, and auditing for best practices may all help you understand how you closed the access gap with your tool. Consider a pre-mortem​ A pre-mortem can be helpful on larger and riskier projects. Pre-mortems are a technique that asks participants to imagine a project's failure in advance, without judgment or blame. Studies show that premortems can increase the success of projects because they make it easier for stakeholders to \"correctly identify the reasons for future outcomes\" by as much as 30%. Once you have identified the future causes of failure, act to reduce the risks, or consider whether the project is still worth trying.","s":"Understanding success metrics","u":"/docs/get_started/working_with_teams","h":"#understanding-success-metrics","p":1439},{"i":1456,"t":"A legal app is always an intervention at a particular point in a larger and more complex process. Your app will need to take into account the before and after steps as well as the steps that you automate. Don't expect to have complete answers to these questions in your first client interview. But you'll need to know all of the answers at different stages in your project. Document the user's ultimate goal and any intermediate goals​ For example: you may automate an estate plan. The user's goal is to identify a guardian for their children and to pass on their assets to specific people. Getting a will or trust is an intermediate goal, not the ultimate success state. Keep the final goal in mind. Identify sources of information​ What primary law sources and secondary sources are important for this project? Who knows about the current process? Identify experts both within and outside the participating organizations Document the before, during, and after​ What steps in the real world must take place before someone can use your tool? For example: before filing an answer in a court case, the defendant has to have been served a complaint. What information will the user need to have ready before they use the tool? For example: they may need to look at the complaint, do a diligent search for military status, or more. You can't wait until the middle of your app to tell them this! What information will the user need to provide when they use the tool? Roughly classify the kind and number of answers needed using the Jarrett and Gaffney framework, namely: Slot-in, or information the user already knows, like their own name and address Gathered, information the user will look up from a readily available source like a court notice or a government ID Third-party, information the user will get by calling someone or looking it up in a database Created, answers the user will make on the spot What decision points will be made during usage of the tool? What branching logic and follow up questions will be needed? How will this change the output document? What sources are available to consult when they use the tool, manually or automatically? For example: Online court docket Case management systems or CRMs Help pages, glossaries, documentation, and videos? What are the output of the tool? What templates will be automated? How will the templates be grouped or bundled for different recipients? Are any documents produced in a mirrored form (for example, for each spouse) or copied for multiple named parties (for example, one per child?) Will any ancillary documents need to be created that aren't already in existence, like: Addenda for overflow text Affidavits Motions What happens after the user completes the automated steps? How will the document be signed or notarized? How will it be served on the other party, if applicable? How will copies be provided to other parties, such as designated agents, hospitals, or others? How will it be filed in court, if applicable? What does the user need to know about the possible outcomes and decisions that will be made based on their document? Should any parts of the process be left un-automated? What compliance or regulation needs to be kept in mind? One approach to this is to interview someone who currently completes the process. Have them pretend that you are the client and ask questions as they walk you through filling in the form or gathering the information needed to complete the document. Interview key stakeholders to get answers. Write down the responses and make your own observations.

If you do not select \"Male\" or \"Female\", your form may include an empty checkbox. We intentionally avoid the use of the word other which is dehumanizing and not inclusive. However, some forms do use other, and it may be appropriate to use any option that is not Female or Male to check an Other box, depending on the use and value of requesting gender on the form.

This detailed accounting of money for each job is required on some financial statements, although in many financial statements, just reporting gross and net income is sufficient. For example, an ALItemizedJob can let the user report: Wages at one hourly rate Overtime at a second hourly rate Tips earned during that time period A fixed salary earned for that pay period Union Dues Insurance Taxes If the financial statement only requires \"gross\" and \"net\" income, the ALJobList has a simpler API and may be the preferred way to represent the income in code.

The field can manage items that are either strings or list-like structures. Handling of dictionary overflow is not currently supported. Attributes: field_name str - The name of a docassemble variable that this object represents. overflow_trigger Union[int, bool] - Specifies the limit after which the text is truncated and moved to an addendum. If set to True, it will always overflow. If set to False, it will never overflow. An integer value represents the maximum character count before overflow. headers Optional[Dict[str, str]] - Mapping of attributes to their display labels for a table representation. Planned for future implementation. field_style Optional[str] - Style of the field, can be one of [\"list\", \"table\", \"string\"]. Defaults to \"string\". Planned for future implementation. Notes: The attributes headers and field_style are planned for future releases and are not currently implemented. overflow_value​ Retrieve the overflow portion of a variable that exceeds the content of safe_value(). This function addresses both list-like objects and strings, ensuring that the returned overflow content adheres to whitespace preferences specified by the parameters. Arguments: preserve_newlines bool, optional - Determines the treatment of newline characters. If True, the returned string can contain single newline characters. Sequences of newline characters, including Windows-style \"rn\", will be reduced to a single \"n\". Double spaces will be replaced with a single space. If False, all whitespace, including newlines and tabs, will be replaced with a single space. Defaults to False. input_width int, optional - The width of the input field or display area, used for determining overflow. Defaults to 80. overflow_message str, optional - Message indicating overflow in the safe value. Defaults to \"\". preserve_words bool, optional - If True, ensures words are not split between the main content and the overflow. Defaults to True. Returns: Any - The portion of the variable exceeding the content safe for display, considered as overflow. max_lines​ Compute the maximum number of lines that can fit in the input given the specified input width. Arguments: input_width int, optional - The width of the input or display area. Defaults to 80. Returns: int - The maximum number of lines accommodated by the input width. value​ Retrieve the complete value without considering overflow constraints. This can be especially helpful in appendices where there's a desire to showcase the entire value without the necessity of toggling between various sections or pages. Returns: Any - The whole value of the field, irrespective of overflow. has_overflow​ Return True only if the value's length exceeds the overflow trigger. Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box. Defaults to 80. preserve_newlines bool - Determines whether newlines are preserved in the \"safe\" text. Defaults to False, which means all newlines are removed. This allows more text to appear before being sent to the addendum. _original_value Any - for speed reasons, you can provide the full text and just use this method to determine if the overflow trigger is exceeded. If no _original_value is provided, this method will determine it using the value_if_defined() method. preserve_words bool - If True, the algorithm will try to preserve whole words when truncating the text. If False, the algorithm will truncate the text at the overflow trigger, regardless of whether it is in the middle of a word. Returns: bool - True if the value's length exceeds the overflow trigger, False otherwise. original_or_overflow_message​ Return the original value if it is less than the overflow trigger (once processed), otherwise return the overflow message. Unlike safe_value(), this will never output a partial value. Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box. Defaults to 80. preserve_newlines bool - Determines whether newlines are preserved in the \"safe\" text. Defaults to False, which means all newlines are removed. This allows more text to appear before being sent to the addendum. _original_value Any - for speed reasons, you can provide the full text and just use this method to determine if the overflow trigger is exceeded. If no _original_value is provided, this method will determine it using the value_if_defined() method. preserve_words bool - If True, the algorithm will try to preserve whole words when truncating the text. If False, the algorithm will truncate the text at the overflow trigger, regardless of whether it is in the middle of a word. Returns: Union[str, List[Any]]: Either a string representing the overflow message or the original value safe_value​ Return just the portion of the variable that heuristics suggest will fit in the specified overflow_trigger limit. If the value is not defined, return an empty string. When preserve_newlines is True, the output will be limited to a number of lines, not a number of characters. The max number of lines will be calculated as floor(self.overflow_trigger/input_width). Therefore, it is important that input_width is a divisor of overflow_trigger. Whitespace will be altered. If preserve_newlines is true, the return value may have newlines, but double newlines and Windows style (rn) will be replaced with n. Double spaces will be replaced with a single space. If preserve_newlines is false, all whitespace, including newlines and tabs, will be replaced with a single space. Arguments: overflow_message str - A short message to go on the page where text is cutoff. input_width int - The width, in characters, of the input box. Defaults to 80. preserve_newlines bool - Determines whether newlines are preserved in the \"safe\" text. Defaults to False, which means all newlines are removed. This allows more text to appear before being sent to the addendum. _original_value Optional[str] - For speed reasons, you can provide the full text and just use this method to determine if the overflow trigger is exceeded. If no _original_value is provided, this method will determine it using the value_if_defined() method. preserve_words bool - Indicates whether words should be preserved in their entirety without being split. Returns: Union[str, List[Any]]: The portion of the variable that fits within the overflow trigger. value_if_defined​ Fetch the value of the designated field if it exists; otherwise, return an empty string. This method ensures that the addendum does not inadvertently trigger docassemble's variable gathering. Returns: Any - The value of the field if it exists, otherwise an empty string. __str__​ Represent the ALAddendumField instance as a string. Returns: str - The string representation of the value contained within the field. columns​ Return a list of the attributes present within the object that would make sense to go in the table of an addendum. If the headers attribute exists, this will be prioritized. Otherwise, the method will infer columns from the first value in the list. Empty attributes and the complete attribute are typically ignored. Arguments: skip_empty_attributes bool, optional - Determines whether empty attributes are included in the list. Defaults to True. skip_attributes Optional[set], optional - A set of attributes to ignore. Defaults to {\"complete\"}. Returns: Optional[list] - A list of columns or None if no meaningful columns can be determined. Notes: The \"location\" attribute of an Address object is always skipped in the column list. type​ Determine the data type of the contained value. Categories: 'list': A simple list. 'object_list': A list containing dictionaries or objects. 'other': Any other type. Returns: str - The type category of the value. is_list​ Check if the field contains a list value, whether it consists of objects, dictionaries, or standard values. Returns: bool - True if the field contains a list, otherwise False. is_object_list​ Determine if the field contains a list of dictionaries or objects. Returns: bool - True if the field contains a list of dictionaries or objects, otherwise False. overflow_markdown​ Generate a markdown representation of the overflow values. The method returns either a markdown table or a bulleted list based on the structure of the values. This utility offers a standardized way to represent overflow content, though users might prefer to manually control the output's format. Returns: str - A markdown representation of the overflow values. overflow_docx​ Insert a formatted table into a docx file, representing the overflow values. This method provides a convenient way to add overflow content into a docx file, although it doesn't offer formatting control. If more formatting flexibility is required, consider directly fetching the overflow values using the overflow_value() method. Arguments: path str, optional - Path to the template docx file to be used. Defaults to a predetermined path. Returns: A docx template with the inserted table.","s":"ALAddendumField Objects","u":"/docs/reference/AssemblyLine/al_document","h":"#aladdendumfield-objects","p":1699},{"i":1704,"t":"class ALAddendumFieldDict(DAOrderedDict) A specialized dictionary for managing fields that may overflow in a document.

Attributes: instanceName str - A unique identifier for the object instance, if available. __getstate__​ Overrides the default method used by Pickle for object serialization. If the object has an instanceName attribute, it is retained during serialization. Otherwise, an empty dictionary is returned, ensuring that other attributes are not persisted across page loads.

Typically there are three: The final version of a document with a signature. E.g., my_doc['final']. The preview version of a document with no signature. E.g., my_doc['preview']. An addendum of a document contained in the attribute addendum. E.g. my_doc.addendum. There is no limit to the number of keys, but the ALDocumentBundle class expects at least a \"final\" key to exist, and the addendum attribute is required if you desire to use PDF documents with text overflow. It is best practice to use exactly the two keys \"final\" and \"preview\" and the attribute \"addendum\". The \"final\" and \"preview\" documents will normally be the same template, but with logic controlling the display of a particular section, such as the signature. Each form that an interview generates should get its own ALDocument object. The \"addendum\" attribute can be handled in a generic object block. Multiple documents can use the same addendum template, with just the case caption varying. ALDocuments are designed to be used contingently as part of ALDocumentBundle objects. Each ALDocument is considered to be \"enabled\" or \"disabled\" for a particular interview user's session. This allows you to always work with a single object representing all of the possible documents an interview can generate, and use encapsulated logic to trigger individual documents inclusion on the final download screen. Attributes: filename str - name used for output PDF title str - display name for the output PDF enabled bool - if this document should be created. See examples. addendum DAFile | DAFileCollection - (optional) an attachment block overflow_fields ALAddendumField - (optional) ALAddendumFieldDict instance. These values will be used to detect and handle overflow. has_addendum bool - (optional) Defaults to False. Set to True if the document could have overflow, like for a PDF template. Notes: The enabled attribute should always be defined by a code block or the objects block, because by default it is considered fresh on each page load. If your interview logic requires that you directly ask the user whether or not to include a document, you can use a single intermediate variable that is posed to the interview user to work around this limitation.

Arguments: **kwargs - Additional keyword arguments that are defined upstream. person (Optional[[Union[str,int]]): Whether to use a first, second, or third person pronoun. Can be one of 1/\"1p\", 2/\"2p\", or 3/\"3p\" (default is 3). See upstream documentation for more information. default (Optional[str]): The default word to use if the pronoun is not defined, e.g. \"the agent\". If not defined, the default term is the user's name. Returns: str - The appropriate pronoun. pronoun_objective​ Returns the same pronoun as the pronoun() method. Arguments: **kwargs - Additional keyword arguments. Returns: str - The appropriate objective pronoun. pronoun_possessive​ Returns a possessive pronoun and a target word, based on attributes. This method will not trigger the definition of gender or pronouns, but it will use them if they are defined, with pronouns taking precedence. As a default, it will either use the value of default or the individual's full name. Given a target word, the function returns \"{pronoun} {target}\". The pronoun could be \"my\", \"her,\" \"his,\" \"its,\" or \"their\". It depends on the gender and person_type attributes and whether the individual is the current user. Arguments: target str - The target word to follow the pronoun. **kwargs - Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to modify the behavior. These might include: default (Optional[str]): The default word to use if the pronoun is not defined, e.g., \"the agent\". If not defined, the default term is the user's name. person (Optional[Union[str, int]]): Whether to use a first, second, or third person pronoun. Can be one of 1/\"1p\", 2/\"2p\", or 3/\"3p\" (default is 3). See upstream documentation for more information. Returns: str - The appropriate possessive phrase, e.g., \"her book\", \"their document\". pronoun_subjective​ Returns a subjective pronoun, based on attributes. The pronoun could be \"you,\" \"we\", \"she,\" \"he,\" \"it,\" or \"they\". It depends on the gender and person_type attributes and whether the individual is the current user. Arguments: **kwargs - Additional keyword arguments that are defined upstream. person (Optional[[Union[str,int]]): Whether to use a first, second, or third person pronoun. Can be one of 1/\"1p\", 2/\"2p\", or 3/\"3p\" (default is 3). See upstream documentation for more information. default (Optional[str]): The default word to use if the pronoun is not defined, e.g. \"the agent\". If not defined, the default term is the user's name. Returns: str - The appropriate subjective pronoun. pronoun_reflexive​ Returns the appropriate reflexive pronoun (\"herself\", \"themself\", \"myself\"), based on the user's pronouns or gender and whether we are asked to return a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person pronoun. Note that if the person has pronouns of they/them/theirs or a nonbinary gender, we return \"themself\" as the singular non-gendered reflexive pronoun and not \"themselves\". This has growing acceptance although some consider it nonstandard. See: https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/themself Arguments: **kwargs - Additional keyword arguments that are defined upstream. person (Optional[[Union[str,int]]): Whether to use a first, second, or third person pronoun. Can be one of 1/\"1p\", 2/\"2p\", or 3/\"3p\" (default is 3).

Equivalent to self.name.firstlast() Returns: str - The individual' familiar​ Returns the individual's name in the most familiar form possible. The purpose is to allow using a short version of the individual's name in an unambiguous way in the interview. For example: referring to the child in a guardianship petition by first name instead of \"the minor\". But there may be a problem if context doesn't make it clear if you are talking about the child or their parent when they share a name. In order, it will try to use: just the first name the first name and suffix the first and middle name the first and last name the full name the default value, e.g., \"the minor\", if provided the full name Arguments: unique_names Optional[List[Any]] - A list of unique names to compare against. Defaults to None. default Optional[str] - The default name to return if no unique name is found. Defaults to None. Returns: str - The individual's name in the most familiar form possible.

Defaults to \"primary\". color_css Optional[str] - A CSS variable or color reference. Defaults to None. size str - The size of the icon. Defaults to \"sm\". Returns: str - HTML for the icon. is_sms_enabled​ Checks if SMS (Twilio) is enabled on the server. Does not verify that it works. See https://docassemble.org/docs/config.html#twilio for more info. Returns: bool - True if there is a non-empty Twilio config on the server, False otherwise is_phone_or_email​ Returns True if the string is either a valid phone number or a valid email address. If SMS is not enabled on the server (through the Twilio config), only accepts emails. Email validation is extremely minimal--just checks for an @ sign between two non-zero length strings.

Note: OpenAI is probabilistic, so the modified run indices may not be correct. When the index of a run or paragraph is out of range, a new paragraph will be inserted at the end of the document or a new run at the end of the paragraph's runs. Take a careful look at the output document to make sure it is still correct. Arguments: document - the docx.Document object, or the path to the DOCX file modified_runs - a tuple of paragraph number, run number, the modified text, a question (not used), and whether a new paragraph should be inserted (for conditional text) Returns: The modified document. get_docx_repr​ Return a JSON representation of the paragraphs and runs in the DOCX file.

Like: (\"clients\", \"the person benefiting from the form\") Returns: A list of tuples, each containing a paragraph number, run number, and the modified text of the run. get_modified_docx_runs​ Use GPT to rewrite the contents of a DOCX file paragraph by paragraph. Does not handle tables, footers, or other structures yet. This is a light wrapper that provides the structure of DOCX paragraphs and runs to your prompt to OpenAI to facilitate the rewriting of the document without disrupting formatting. For example, this could be used to: Remove any passive voice Replace placeholder text with variable names Rewrite to a 6th grade reading level Do an advanced search and replace, without requiring you to use a regex By default, the example prompt includes a sample like this: [ [0, 0, \"Dear \"], [0, 1, \"John Smith:\"], [1, 0, \"I hope this letter finds you well.\"], ] Your custom instructions should include an example of how the sample will be modified, like the one below: Example reply, indicating paragraph, run, the new text, and a number indicating if this changes the current paragraph, adds one before, or adds one after (-1, 0, 1): {\"results\": [ [0, 1, \"Dear {{ other_parties[0] }}:\", 0], [2, 0, \"{%p if is_tenant %}\", -1], [3, 0, \"{%p endif %}\", 1], ] } You may also want to customize the input example to better match your use case.

They may include a choice, creating a narrative, or even applying legal reasoning. \"Affidavits\" are a special form of created answers. See Jarret and Gaffney, Forms That Work (2008) classify_field​ Apply heuristics to the field's original and \"normalized\" name to classify it as either a \"slot-in\", \"gathered\", \"third party\" or \"created\" field type. get_adjusted_character_count​ Determines the bracketed length of an input field based on its max_length attribute, returning a float representing the approximate length of the field content. The function chunks the answers into 5 different lengths (checkboxes, 2 words, short, medium, and long) instead of directly using the character count, as forms can allocate different spaces for the same data without considering the space the user actually needs. Arguments: field FieldInfo - An object containing information about the input field, including the \"max_length\" attribute. Returns: float - The approximate length of the field content, categorized into checkboxes, 2 words, short, medium, or long based on the max_length attribute.

It is hand-written for now. It will factor in the input type, the answer type (slot in, gathered, third party or created), and the amount of input text allowed in the field. The return value is a function that can return N samples of how long it will take to answer the field (in minutes) time_to_answer_form​ Provide an estimate of how long it would take an average user to respond to the questions on the provided form. We use signals such as the field type, name, and space provided for the response to come up with a rough estimate, based on whether the field is: fill in the blank gathered - e.g., an id number, case number, etc. third party: need to actually ask someone the information - e.g., income of not the user, anything else? created: a. short created (3 lines or so?) b. long created (anything over 3 lines) cleanup_text​ Apply cleanup routines to text to provide more accurate readability statistics. text_complete​ Run a prompt via openAI's API and return the result.

If tools_passive​ Ping passive voice API for list of sentences using the passive voice get_passive_sentences​ Return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a sentence in which passive voice was detected along with a list of the starting and ending position of each fragment that is phrased in the passive voice. The combination of the two can be used in the PDFStats frontend to highlight the passive text in an individual sentence. Text can either be a string or a list of strings. If provided a single string, it will be tokenized with NTLK and sentences containing fewer than 2 words will be ignored. get_citations​ Get citations and some extra surrounding context (the full sentence), if the citation is fewer than 5 characters (often eyecite only captures a section symbol for state-level short citation formats) get_sensitive_data_types​ Given a list of fields, identify those related to sensitive information and return a dictionary with the sensitive fields grouped by type. A list of the old field names can also be provided. These fields should be in the same order. Passing the old field names allows the sensitive field algorithm to match more accurately. The return value will not contain the old field name, only the corresponding field name from the first parameter. The sensitive data types are: Bank Account Number, Credit Card Number, Driver's License Number, and Social Security Number. substitute_phrases​ Substitute phrases in the input string and return the new string and positions of substituted phrases. Arguments: input_string str - The input string containing phrases to be replaced. substitution_phrases Dict[str, str] - A dictionary mapping original phrases to their replacement phrases. Returns: Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, int]]]: A tuple containing the new string with substituted phrases and a list of tuples, each containing the start and end positions of the substituted phrases in the new string. Example: >>> input_string = \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\" >>> substitution_phrases = {\"quick brown\": \"swift reddish\", \"lazy dog\": \"sleepy canine\"} >>> new_string, positions = substitute_phrases(input_string, substitution_phrases) >>> print(new_string) \"The swift reddish fox jumped over the sleepy canine.\" >>> print(positions) [(4, 17), (35, 48)] substitute_neutral_gender​ Substitute gendered phrases with neutral phrases in the input string.

Source of terms is drawn from https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/ transformed_sentences​ Apply a function to a list of sentences and return only the sentences with changed terms. The result is a tuple of the original sentence, new sentence, and the starting and ending position of each changed fragment in the sentence. parse_form​ Read in a pdf, pull out basic stats, attempt to normalize its form fields, and re-write the in_file with the new fields (if rewrite=1). If you pass a spot token, we will guess the NSMI code. If you pass openai creds, we will give suggestions for the title and description. form_complexity​ Gets a single number of how hard the form is to complete.

Example: rename_pdf_fields(&#x27;current.pdf&#x27;, &#x27;new_field_names.pdf&#x27;, \\{&#x27;abc123&#x27;: &#x27;user1_name&#x27;, &#x27;abc124&#x27;, &#x27;user1_address_city&#x27;\\}) Args: in_file: the filename of an input file out_file: the filename of the output file. Doesn&#x27;t need to exist, will be overwritten if it does exist. mapping: the python dict that maps from a current field name to the desired name Returns: Nothing #### unlock\\_pdf\\_in\\_place Try using pikePDF to unlock the PDF it it is locked. This won&#x27;t work if it has a non-zero length password. #### has\\_fields Check if a PDF has at least one form field using PikePDF. **Arguments**: - `pdf_file` _str_ - The path to the PDF file. **Returns**: - `bool` - True if the PDF has at least one form field, False otherwise. #### get\\_existing\\_pdf\\_fields Use PikePDF to get fields from the PDF #### swap\\_pdf\\_page (DEPRECATED: use copy_pdf_fields) Copies the AcroForm fields from one PDF to another blank PDF form. Optionally, choose a starting page for both the source and destination PDFs. By default, it will remove any existing annotations (which include form fields) in the destination PDF. If you wish to append annotations instead, specify `append_fields = True` #### copy\\_pdf\\_fields Copies the AcroForm fields from one PDF to another blank PDF form (without AcroForm fields). Useful for getting started with an updated PDF form, where the old fields are pretty close to where they should go on the new document. Optionally, you can choose a starting page for both the source and destination PDFs. By default, it will remove any existing annotations (which include form fields) in the destination PDF. If you wish to append annotations instead, specify `append_fields = True` **Example**: ```python new_pdf_with_fields = copy_pdf_fields( source_pdf=\"old_pdf.pdf\", destination_pdf=\"new_pdf_with_no_fields.pdf\") new_pdf_with_fields.save(\"new_pdf_with_fields.pdf\") Arguments: source_pdf - a file name or path to a PDF that has AcroForm fields destination_pdf - a file name or path to a PDF without AcroForm fields. Existing fields will be removed. source_offset - the starting page that fields will be copied from. Defaults to 0. destination_offset - the starting page that fields will be copied to. Defaults to 0. append_annotations - controls whether formfyxer will try to append form fields instead of overwriting. Defaults to false; when enabled may lead to undefined behavior. Returns: A pikepdf.Pdf object with new fields. If blank_pdf was a pikepdf.Pdf object, the same object is returned. get_textboxes_in_pdf​ Gets all of the text boxes found by pdfminer in a PDF, as well as their bounding boxes get_bracket_chars_in_pdf​ Gets all of the bracket characters ('[' and ']') found by pdfminer in a PDF, as well as their bounding boxes TODO: Will eventually be used to find [ ] as checkboxes, but right now we can't tell the difference between [ ] and [i]. This simply gets all of the brackets, and the characters of [hi] in a PDF and [ ] are the exact same distance apart. Currently going with just \"[hi]\" doesn't happen, let's hope that assumption holds. intersect_bbox​ bboxes are [left edge, bottom edge, horizontal length, vertical length] intersect_bboxs​ Returns an iterable of booleans, one of each of the input bboxes, true if it collides with bbox_a contain_boxes​ Given two bounding boxes, return a single bounding box that contains both of them. get_dist_sq​ returns the distance squared between two points. Faster than the true euclidean dist get_dist​ euclidean (L^2 norm) distance between two points get_connected_edges​ point list is always ordered clockwise from the bottom left, i.e. bottom left, top left, top right, bottom right bbox_distance​ Gets our specific \"distance measure\" between two different bounding boxes. This distance is roughly the sum of the horizontal and vertical difference in alignment of the closest shared field-bounding box edge. We are trying to find which, given a list of text boxes around a field, is the most likely to be the actual text label for the PDF field. bboxes are 4 floats, x, y, width and height get_possible_fields​ Given an input PDF, runs a series of heuristics to predict where there might be places for user enterable information (i.e. PDF fields), and returns those predictions. Example: fields = get_possible_fields('no_field.pdf') print(fields[0][0]) # Type: FieldType.TEXT, Name: name, User name: , X: 67.68, Y: 666.0, Configs: \\{'fieldFlags': 'doNotScroll', 'width': 239.4, 'height': 16\\} Arguments: in_pdf_file - the input PDF textboxes optional - the location of various lines of text in the PDF. If not given, will be calculated automatically. This allows us to pass through expensive info to calculate through several functions. Returns: For each page in the input PDF, a list of predicted form fields get_possible_checkboxes​ Uses boxdetect library to determine if there are checkboxes on an image of a PDF page. Assumes the checkbox is square. find_small: if true, finds smaller checkboxes. Sometimes will \"find\" a checkbox in letters, like O and D, if the font is too small get_possible_radios​ Even though it's called \"radios\", it just gets things shaped like circles, not doing any semantic analysis yet. get_possible_text_fields​ Uses openCV to attempt to find places where a PDF could expect an input text field. Caveats so far: only considers straight, normal horizonal lines that don't touch any vertical lines as fields Won't find field inputs as boxes default_line_height: the default height (16 pt), in pixels (at 200 dpi), which is 45 auto_add_fields​ Uses get_possible_fields and set_fields to automatically add new detected fields to an input PDF. Example: auto_add_fields('no_fields.pdf', 'newly_added_fields.pdf') Arguments: in_pdf_file - the input file name or path of the PDF where we'll try to find possible fields out_pdf_file - the output file name or path of the PDF where a new version of in_pdf_file will be stored, with the new fields. Doesn't need to existing, but if a file does exist at that filename, it will be overwritten. Returns: Nothing is_tagged​ Determines if the input PDF file is tagged for accessibility. Arguments: in_pdf_file Union[str, Path] - The path to the PDF file, as a string or a Path object. Returns: bool - True if the PDF is tagged, False otherwise.","s":"FormField Objects","u":"/docs/reference/formfyxer/pdf_wrangling","h":"#formfield-objects","p":1777},{"i":1785,"t":"In Docassemble, a review screen is the way that a user can make changes to their answers. A review screen displays one or more of the user's existing answers along with buttons that let the user edit each choice.

Like the list of fields in a question screen, one review screen can let the user review many answers. This list of answers goes under the heading review instead of fields. Each answer you want to let your user change includes: A button, with a label of your choice (we usually use \"Edit\") Fields that you want the user to revisit when they click the edit button Some preview of the user's current answer. It's common to repeat or paraphrase the question from the interview and show the answer next to the question. You can do more advanced things with review screens, too: If you want the user to jump to another screen, perhaps they could edit multiple fields asked over several different screens in the interview, you can make the field name point to another question screen, labeled with an event. This is usually used to edit lists of people with a revisit block. You can trigger follow-up code to run after the user makes a change. For example: you can trigger a code block to re-run, delete the value of another answer, or trigger another follow-up screen. Writing a review screen is important. Without one, the only way a user can change their answers is with the \"back\" button, but the \"back\" button will undo the user's progress in the interview so far. Review screens are necessary for interviews to be fully WCAG compliant; for legal applications, WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.4 requires that a mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission For docassemble applications, this means a review screen that allows the user to correct the information they entered needs to be present at the end of your interview.","s":"Why make a review screen?","u":"/docs/review_screen","h":"#why-make-a-review-screen","p":1782},{"i":1790,"t":"Large changes to an interview's logic will require large changes to the review screen as well.

You can download the YAML file either: from the docassemble playground, clicking on the \"Download\" button below the YAML editor, or from GitHub. For example, for the Motion to Stay Eviction, you can navigate to the primary YAML file, SP6A.yml, and click the \"download raw file\" button. You should download all of the YAML files that define variables used in your interview. The more YAML files you download, the more content you might have to cut from the generated review screen. Once you have the YAML files, go to the ALDashboard's review screen generator, and upload your YAML files. You should leave the two checkboxes (\"create revisit screens\", and \"point section blocks to review screen\") checked, and press \"continue\". The next screen will have your review blocks! Make a file called review.yml in your playground, and copy the content from the review screen generator into it. Then, add a block in your main interview near the end like this: include: - review.yml","s":"Step 1: AL Review Generator","u":"/docs/review_screen","h":"#step-1-al-review-generator","p":1782},{"i":1794,"t":"About |- The generated YAML uses lots of |-. In short, something like this: event: |- review_intro code: |- review_form is the same as this: event: review_intro code: | review_form I'd recommend changing the YAML to how you normally write it to be more concise 1. The remainder of the examples will use the more concise YAML notation. There are a few sections of the generated review screen YAML: There are the events. These blocks look like this: event: review_intro code: | review_form --- event: review_prior_case code: | review_form These blocks take each section from your interview and make it so that if a user clicks on the section, they are brought to the review page. In our experience, this works best, as all of the information that the interview asks can be edited in one place, and the user doesn't have to remember which section a piece of information belonged to. The main review block. The block looks like this: id: review screen event: review_form question: | Review your answers review: - Edit: users.revisit button: | **Users** % for item in users: - ${ item } % endfor - Edit: has_existing_case button: | **Do you have an existing Michigan family court case?** Do you have an existing Michigan family court case?: ${ word(yesno(has_existing_case)) } This block looks like a normal question block, except there is a review attribute instead of fields. Each list item under the review attribute is generated from question screens in the interview, and shows the text content and the fields from that question screen. Each element in the review can have the following dictionary attributes: Edit adds an \"Edit\" button in this section of the review screen. When clicked, the \"Edit\" button will take the user to fields on the right side of the : they have already answered. These fields can be: A single field, e.g. Edit: has_existing_case A list of fields. Each of the fields will be re-shown to the user. e.g. - Edit: - who_pays - which_side_pays You can also use recompute as an item in the list that contains a sub-list of fields to re-calculate using code blocks, without asking questions to the user again. You won't see recompute in your generated interview, but you should add it if necessary. Here's an example: - Edit: - county_choice - recompute: - trial_court button acts like the subquestion of this section of the review screen. It is where you should display the current value of the field or fields you want to let the user edit. You can use multiple lines and Mako tags in this area. The revisit screens. These blocks look like this: id: revisit users continue button field: users.revisit question: | Edit your answers about Users subquestion: | ${ users.table } ${ users.add_action() } Revisit screens are used to let people edit items in DALists. For each of the other variables in the review block, clicking their \"Edit\" button brings users directly to the question to let them edit their answers. That approach works well for simple variables like text, dates that the user enters, or yes no questions. But your interview might include objects and lists of objects, like a list of plaintiffs and another list of defendants. Instead of re-asking every question that someone answered to fill the list, docassemble brings to the user to a revisit screen that shows each item in the list to the user, and lets them choose which to edit individually. If you used the Weaver to make your interview, your interview might have a few different lists for people, like users, other_parties, children, debt_collectors, and guardians. The revisit screens each show the table attribute of the DAList. If needed, blocks defining the table for the lists will appear at the end of the generated review file. table: children.table rows: children columns: - Birthdate: | row_item.birthdate if hasattr(row_item, 'birthdate') else '' edit: - birthdate Edits to the Review Screen​ You'll want to change some aspects of the generated review screen. Note that if any errors happen in a specific edit element on the review screen, that element won't appear. It also won't appear if the attribute or variable to be edited doesn't exist. You should make sure that it does. Some common issues to the generated review screen that I personally have run into before: Remove generated revisit and table blocks for attachments and other non-people objects, if any, as well as their entries in the review block. revisit is only needed for things the user enters themselves. Since the review screen generator can't determine which object types people have to enter information for, it generates them for all objects. Remove questions you don't want the user to edit. Sometimes, you will have questions that do set a variable in the interview, but the variable isn't used in the interview logic after that. For example, a question that's only use is to kickout a user if their problem isn't covered by the form. Here's an example of one: --- question: | Are you Filing in a Probate Case? fields: - Is your case a probate case?: probate_case datatype: yesnoradio --- event: probate_case_exit question: | You cannot continue to use the tool. subquestion: | Based on your answer, you can't use this tool. Probate cases have different procedural rules than other cases. You may want to speak to a lawyer. If you made a mistake, click the **Undo** button. Otherwise, click the **Exit** button to return to Michigan Legal Help. buttons: - Exit: exit url: https://michiganlegalhelp.org If editing the value of a variable like this would only lead the person to a kickout screen and not change any other logic of the interview, then the generated review section should be removed.","s":"Step 2: Understanding and Editing the Generated Review Screen","u":"/docs/review_screen","h":"#step-2-understanding-and-editing-the-generated-review-screen","p":1782},{"i":1796,"t":"You'll find that certain variables often depend on each other, either explicitly or implicitly. For example, if you have a variable called hearing_date_and_time that you set to hearing_date + \" \" + hearing_time, you should recompute that field whenever the user edits the hearing date or time. You can do something like this to update the variable whenever you edit the hearing date: - label: Edit fields: - hearing_date - recompute: - hearing_date_and_time button: | ... Another example of when two variables are implicitly dependent would be if you asked the user if the plaintiff or defendant is paying child support. If the user changes what side of the case they are on, their answer to what side is paying might change too! You can use a review entry that looks like this to edit both. - label: Edit fields: - user_ask_role - who_paid As mentioned in step 2, if a variable doesn't exist or any errors occur when showing a section of the review screen, that whole section won't be shown. If some of the fields on a screen or optional, then their absence can cause their section of the review screen to not appear. Use showifdef on optional fields, or fields that use show if, to prevent this issue. While writing the review screen, you will likely have to redo your interview logic, so that it doesn't make assumptions about the presence or absence of variables, just their values, which I'd encourage. From the docassemble documentation: For example, if you ask “Do you want to include your cell phone number?” and then you ask “What is your cell phone number,” the user’s cell phone number will be defined. If the user then changes the answer to the “Do you want to include your cell phone number?” question, then you will have a situation where the user’s cell phone number is defined but it should not be used.
