- [x] [Removed the term] Not tell people about 3rd party packages at all. Part of the problem - these docs don’t explain what third party is. Maybe move to appendix. Maybe say why they should trust is there in appendix.
- [x] [Not sure I solved this problem] Everything is 3rd party.

This page will help you learn some steps you can take to protect yourself and your users as you develop your code with ALKiln tests. It will also talk about the [security practices ALKiln itself uses](#alkilns-precautions).

:::caution Critical reading
Read at least the first section on this page - [using a separate server for testing](#privilege).
:::

In software development, security can be an intimidating topic. By design, ALKiln tests are unable to do very much, but all software comes with risks. We can mitigate those risks with robust security measures. Over time, we can all build up our security tool chests to:

- Protect our users' information
- Protect our security-critical information
- Protect our servers

We want to protect against anything that might expose or modify any important or sensitive data.

One of our strongest tools to increase security is the [principle of least privilege](#privilege).

<!--
- Unintentionally showing your users' personally identifying information (PII).
- Exposing security information, like configuration tokens.
- Giving access to editing admin and developer files, like the configuration file.
- Giving access to editing the underlying server files.
-->


## Principle of least privilege {#privilege}

Follow the [principle of least privilege](https://www.cyberark.com/what-is/least-privilege/). It is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and your users. Only give ALKiln, or any software, access to the data it needs and no more.


### Separate production and testing {#testing-server}

**This is for:** Everyone

Using a separate testing server and separate testing data are some of the most effective ways to limit ALKiln's access to personal and security-critical data.

There are some kinds of tests that projects run on their production server, but ALKiln is in a different category of tests. Limiting ALKiln's access means it:

- Never has access to actual user information
- Never has access to your production server's security-critical data like configuration tokens
- Never has access to your current or old production databases
- Can never affect the files on your production server

First and foremost, avoid installing or running <GTOYS/> and <AutoDIY/> tests on your production server[^bonus]. Have a separate server for those testing methods. <KittyLitter plain={true}/> tests already make their own server and can be the most secure if you [use them properly](#sandbox). Use those if you are [able to use them](setup.mdx#sandbox-cons).

A separate server is only one part of separating production and testing sever access, though. You also need to:

- Keep the production server's urls out of ALKiln test files, [workflow files](writing_tests.mdx#workflows), and [environment variables](#writing_tests.mdx#env-vars).
- Never share API keys or passwords between servers.
- Never share real data or databases between servers, whether the data is current or old.

<!-- TODO: Link to old credit card numbers predicting new credit card numbers -->


[^bonus]: Using a different server for testing is better in other ways, too. When developers pull packages that have python files onto your docassemble server, it reloads for a while. This can cause your clients' interviews to time out. <GTOYS/> tests do the same and can make for a slower user experience if they are used on a production server.


### Use fake data in tests {#mock data}

**This is for**: Everyone

Determined people can do a lot with very little data. For example, they can [use even anonymized data](https://www.wired.com/2007/12/why-anonymous-data-sometimes-isnt) to identify your users. Avoid giving your ALKiln tests access to real data, even if it is old data.

For example, if your production server uses a google spreadsheet to store some user or server data, create a separate google spreadsheet with fake data for your testing server. If you need help creating fake data, sites or tools like https://cobbl.io/ might be useful.

Some projects instead use old data for testing. Avoid that as well. Even if it seems so outdated as to be useless, it can still expose you and your users.


### Make an account just for ALKiln {#alkiln-account}

**This is for any packages:** Everyone

<!-- TODO: add a section for setup about making an account. take it away from the setup interview like other stuff. Then link to in here and visa versa. -->

Avoid giving ALKiln access to an actual developer's name, username, password, API keys, and other sensitive information by giving ALKiln its own account. This also lets you see its activity in the logs more clearly and delete the account easily if you need to. There are non-security related reasons to make a separate account too[^perks].

<GTOYS/> tests need to be connected to a docassemble account to work properly. Even if you are using other types of tests, your tests may need an account. For example, you may want a test to sign into an account before going to an interview.

<!-- TODO: Move to creating an account section when it exists: If you use <GTOYS/> tests, you need to put those values in your GitHub secrets. If you lose the sign-in information for that account, delete it, create a new one, and update the secrets. -->

Only give ALKiln an account if necessary. Make sure no one else uses the account. Give that account [a role with only the privileges it needs](#alkiln_role) and no more. Also avoid giving it other real data or access. For example, avoid giving it any real person's name and avoid giving it GitHub integration.

We usually call the ALKiln user "automated_tests" and give it the email "automated_tests@example.com" with a secure password.

If you stop needing the account, delete it.

<!-- TODO: add link to GitHub secrets? -->


[^perks]: There are other good reasons to avoid using an existing developer's account that are not related to security. For one thing, the tests create Projects and run interviews. It may be confusing for an existing developer to find those in their account. For another thing, if you do use a real developer's account and that developer leaves your organization, tests will start failing. It may take you a while to track down the problem and fix it.


### ALKiln account role {#alkiln_role}

ALKiln strongly limits what tests can do. Even so, you should give the ALKiln account the fewest permissions possible.

For <GTOYS/> tests, give the ALKiln docassemble account the [role](https://docassemble.org/docs/users.html) of "developer". That is the most limited role ALKiln can use to do what it needs to do. Avoid giving that account's API key any [extra permissions](https://docassemble.org/docs/config.html#permissions).

If your <AutoDIY/> tests need an account on your server, give them the least privileges possible. In those cases, most authors only need to give ALKiln the "user" role.

<KittyLitter/> tests run on their own server, create their own account, and manage their own permissions.


<!--
## General server practices {#servers}

**This is for:** Everyone

Here are a couple general good tips for keeping your testing server healthy:

- Periodically clear out the testing server and start a new docker container from scratch
- Occasionally check the testing server to make sure it's not running resource-stealing code (blockchain miners, etc.)
-->


## Still protect sensitive data {#sensitive-data}

Even after keeping personal and security-critical data away from [the account that runs ALKiln tests](#alkiln-account), there are still ways you can expose some sensitive data in tests. For example, it is possible to deliberately show a server config value on an interview page. Even if you are using a testing server, that server still has credentials, like API keys and passwords, and you should protect those.

<!-- TODO: Link to env vars? -->

It is possible to use sensitive information to fill in fields in your tests, though, if you do it correctly using environment variables. ALKiln is careful to [protect against showing information you put in environment variables](#alkiln-env-vars).


### Avoid sensitive data in package files {#sensitive-info-files}

**This is for any packages that:** have files that can be seen by the public

Avoid putting personal or security-critical information in your package's files. It is possible that someone will see those files. For example, if you have a pubic repository on GitHub, anyone can see your package's files.

If you need to use sensitive information in your tests:

- For tests running in GitHub, [add a GitHub secret](#sensitive-info-github)
- For <AutoDIY/> tests, [add a variable in your docassemble configuration file](#sensitive-info-playground)


### Avoid showing sensitive data on screen {#no-show}

Avoid visually showing personal or security-critical data on an interview page. For example, it is possible to deliberately show a server config value on an interview page. Even though you yourself can try to avoid [taking pictures of pages](writing_tests.mdx#pics) with personal or security-critical data, an error can happen on that page. ALKiln takes pictures of pages that error and there is no way that ALKiln can know that the contents of that page are sensitive.

<!-- TODO: ALKiln: allow users to prevent all error pics and html pages. -->


### Avoid JSON Steps with sensitive data {#json-vars}

The ["get JSON"](writing_tests.mdx#get-json) and ["compare JSON"](writing_tests.mdx#compare-json) Steps show a page's JSON variables by logging them, saving them in a file, or both. ALKiln is currently unable to filter out sensitive values - personal or security-critical data - in that JSON. Only use those Steps when you are sure the JSON will be safe to show.


### How to use sensitive data in GitHub tests {#sensitive-info-github}

**This is for any packages that:** run tests in GitHub

**To do this you MUST be:**

- Either the GitHub repository admin or
- the GitHub organization admin

These are the only people that can create GitHub secrets

**To do this it helps to know about:**

- GitHub secrets
- Workflow environment variables
- [Editing GitHub files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files)

<!-- TODO: Rearrange - Maybe use this section to refer to another section that is more focused on setting arbitrary environment variables in general -->

Sometimes authors do need to pass personal or security-critical information to their tests. For example, some tests require the "user" to [sign in](writing_tests.mdx##sign-in), so the tests need to know the email and password for that user. In GitHub, you can do this securely by using [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) and adding environment variables to your repository's GitHub workflow file. You can also read about [how to use sensitive information with <AutoDIY plain={true}/> tests](#sensitive-info-playground).

1. Follow the [GitHub instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) to set one or more GitHub secrets. You can add these to one repository's secrets or you can add these to your organization's secrets[^org_secrets], whichever is right for you.

2. Go to the home page of your repository. Tap on the `.github` folder, then on `workflows` folder, then on the YAML file in there that runs the ALKiln tests.

3. It should include a line that looks similar to this:

```yml
jobs:
  alkiln-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run ALKiln tests
```

If this is the first environment variable you're adding, right below that last line add a new line like this:

```yml
    env:
```

4. Whenever you want to add a secret, add a new line under `env:` indented from `env:`:

```yml
      ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD: "${{ secrets.ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD }}"
```

`ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD` is just a placeholder in our example. You can name your secrets whatever you want to. Make sure the name here matches your GitHub secret name.

5. Write your Step and use the names of these secrets as the values. For example:

```gherkin
    And I set the variable "very_secure_password" to "ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD"
```

<!-- TODO: put this in an appropriate place
If you're not worried about keeping the information secure, you don't have to use a GitHub secret - you can just put the value straight into your workflow file like this:

```yml
  ALKILN_MAX_SECONDS_FOR_SERVER_RELOAD: "300"
```

ALKiln will still avoid printing this value and avoid taking screenshots when it is used. There is no way ALKiln can tell which environment variables have sensitive information and which ones are safe.
 -->

Your workflow file code will end up including something like the below:

```yml
# Other workflow code

jobs:
  alkiln-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run ALKiln tests
    env:
      ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD: "${{ secrets.ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD }}"

# Other workflow code
```

<!-- TODO: Move this to #env-vars -->

We recommend that you start your environment variable names with "ALKILN_". That will help avoid conflicting with the environment variables of your operating system.

<SecureEnvVars/>

Right now Story Tables are unable to use environment variables to set variables.


<!-- TODO: Move this to writing_tests.mdx #env-vars -->

[^org_secrets]: [GitHub organization secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-an-organization) can be useful if an organization wants to create a variable that all of its repositories will be able to use and avoid creating that secret in every individual repository.


### How to use sensitive information in <AutoDIY/> tests {#sensitive-info-playground}

**This is for:** <AutoDIY/> tests

**To do this you MUST be able to:**

- Edit your docassemble server's config file

Sometimes authors do need to pass personal or security-critical information to their tests. For example, some tests require the "user" to log in, so the tests need to know the email and password for that user. You can do this securely in your <AutoDIY/> tests by adding this information to your docassemble server configuration file. ALKiln will use these as environment variables for your tests.

You can also read about [how to use sensitive information in GitHub tests](#sensitive-info-github).

To do this, [edit your docassemble server's configuration file](https://docassemble.org/docs/config.html#edit) to add your environment variables under the `alkiln` key. For example:

```yml
# Other config values
alkiln:
  ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD: 123password
```

The use that environment variable name in your test. For example:

```gherkin
    And I set the variable "very_secure_password" to "ALKILN_USER_PASSWORD"
```

We recommend that you start your environment variable names with "ALKILN_". That will help avoid conflicting with the environment variables of your operating system.

<SecureEnvVars/>

Right now Story Tables are unable to use environment variables to fill in fields.


### <KittyLitter/> tests {#sandbox}

**This is for any packages that:** have <KittyLitter/> tests

<KittyLitter/> are very secure if you use them correctly. You still have to take some care.

Avoid using hard-coded urls that lead to your server. That is, avoid using `https://my-testing-server.com` and interviews or other pages there. That kind of url will send the tests to your server, which escapes the sandbox that is useful about the <KittyLitter/> method and makes the tests less secure again.

You also still have to avoid saving personal or security-critical information in public files and follow other security precautions, like the ones described in this documentation.


## Freeze the ALKiln framework version {#freeze-framework}

**This is for any packages that:** run tests in GitHub

**To do this it helps to know about:**

- [Editing GitHub files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files)
- GitHub workflow files
- GitHub action inputs
- [Semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning)

Freezing your version of ALKiln's framework code gives you more control over the ALKiln framework code you use. You can examine new code before deciding whether to update to a newer version.

The ALKiln framework is the part of ALKiln that lets you control the robot that goes through your interview answering questions. This is different from the ALKiln actions, which trigger GitHub to start your tests.

The workflow file we first create for you in the ALKiln setup interview always uses the latest major version[^v] of the ALKiln framework. That major version is based on when you used the setup interview. As of March 2024, ALKiln is on major version 5. Tests that authors set up now will use the latest version 5 code. For example, version `5.10.1` as of March 12, 2024.

This means that the ALKiln framework you are using has all the latest bug fixes and new features. That can be a good thing, but it also means you might not be sure of exactly what code runs your tests.

[ALKiln itself already uses practices that protect you from malicious actors](#alkilns-precautions). There is a way to make sure to always use an exact version of the ALKiln framework, though, if you want. You can use a version that has code and behavior that you are familiar with and feel comfortable with.

To "freeze" your ALKiln framework version in this way, you can reference a [specific ALKiln package version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suffolklitlab/alkiln?activeTab=versions) in your workflow <!-- TODO: add link --> file. Go to the code in your workflow file that looks similar to the below and add the `ALKILN_VERSION` input variable that you see here:

```yml
        uses: SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln@v5
        with:
          SERVER_URL: "${{ secrets.SERVER_URL }}"
          DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY: "${{ secrets.DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY }}"
          ALKILN_VERSION: "5.9.0"
```

Instead of "5.9.0", write the version you want to use.

When you want to update to a new version of the framework, you can check all the new changes to the code to make sure you feel comfortable with them before updating to a new node version.

:::tip
This is different than [the ALKiln action versions](#freeze-actions). The ALKiln actions let you start your tests on GitHub. You do usually need to make sure these match, though, as they work together. When you update one, you should also update the other.
:::

[^v]: ALKiln does its best to use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## Freeze an ALKiln action version {#freeze-actions}

**This is for any packages that:** run tests in GitHub

**To do this it helps to know about:**

- [Editing GitHub files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files)
- [GitHub workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows)
- [Git commit ids](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits#about-commits) (usually called the commit SHA[^SHA] or hash)

Freezing your version of ALKiln's actions gives you more control over the ALKiln action code you use. You can examine new code before deciding whether to update to a newer version.

You use ALKiln's actions in your workflow file <!-- TODO: add link --> to trigger GitHub tests. This is different from the actual ALKiln framework, which lets you control the robot that goes through your interview answering questions.

The workflow file we first create for you in the ALKiln setup interview always uses the latest ALKiln action code. As of March 2024, the setup interview used the latest code of a branch on ALKiln called "v5" for its actions.

This means that your ALKiln action has all the latest bug fixes and new features to the actions. That can be a good thing, but it also means you might not be sure of exactly what code starts your tests.

[ALKiln itself already uses practices that protect you from malicious actors](#alkilns-precautions). There is a way to make sure to always use an exact version of ALKiln's actions, though, if you want. You can use a version that has code and behavior that you are familiar with and feel comfortable with.

To "freeze" your ALKiln action version in this way, you can reference a specific ALKiln git commit id (or SHA[^SHA]) in your workflow file:

1. Go to [ALKiln's repository](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln).
2. Find the id of a commit you need. You need the full commit id which is 40 random characters. For example, a29519914ffc235802be9b9b143d78ffc3a06028.
   1. To find the commit id, go to the main page of [ALKiln's GitHub repo](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln).
   1. Pick the branch of ALKiln that is relevant to you.
   1. Near the top, click on “commits".
   1. Find the commit that you want. On the right-hand side of that row will be the shortened version of the commit id. To the right of that is the “copy” button.
   1. Click that to copy the full commit id.
3. In your repository's directory, go to .github/workflows and find the file that starts the tests. There's a line in there that look's something like this:

```yml
uses: suffolkLITLab/ALKiln@v5
```

4. Change the text "v5" to the commit id. For example:

```yml
uses: suffolkLITLab/ALKiln@a29519914ffc235802be9b9b143d78ffc3a06028
```

When you want to update to a new version of the ALKiln action code, you can check all the new changes to the code to make sure you feel comfortable with them before updating to a new commit id.

:::tip
This is different than the [ALKiln framework version](#freeze-framework). The framework does more than just start your tests. It is the code that lets you control the robot that goes through your interview answering questions. You do usually need to make sure these match, though, as they work together. When you update one, you should also update the other.
:::


[^SHA]: SHA stands for "secure hash algorithm". Git has a secure hash algorithm of its own to make an "id" for each commit. Very broadly, for each commit a repository makes, git uses math to reliably turn the whole history of the package and all its versions, including the newest commit, into 40 letters and numbers. Unlike a branch name, a commit SHA is unable to be changed or edited because it is created from that history (though it can be deleted). Because of this, you can pretty much rely on a commit SHA to always go to either the same code or no code at all. That is, no one can hide sneaky new code there.

<!-- [^♪]: You can hear your SHA at [SHAlala](https://garrett-bodley.github.io/SHAlala/). -->


## Update your ALKiln and other tools when needed {#update}

Update your tools, especially when that update includes a security fix. Check the [changelog of ALKiln](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln/blob/-/CHANGELOG.md) and your other tools for security updates.

Choosing when to update to the latest version of software can be tricky. New features and bug fixes can interfere with your working system. That said, when there is a security update you might have to go ahead with the update.

Your tools should keep a record of their changes, often called a "changelog". Those records should clearly label security updates. Keep an eye out for those updates.

For example, [this is one of ALKiln's security updates](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln/blob/-/CHANGELOG.md#security-1).


## General GitHub practices {#github}


### Protect pull requests {#prs}

**This is for any packages that:** run tests in GitHub

It is possible for you to add code <!-- TODO: Add link to description of that code --> to your workflow file <!-- TODO: Add link workflow file --> to trigger tests when someone makes a pull request on GitHub. If you decide to do that, take extra steps to make sure malicious coders are unable to trigger your workflows.

If you configure your workflows to be triggered by a pull request, someone can change the code of the tests, workflows, or other package code to do something malicious, then trigger that code by just making a pull request.

By default, GitHub [prevents first-time contributors from triggering pull request workflows without your permission](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/approving-workflow-runs-from-public-forks). Unfortunately, some people make first-time contributions that are very reasonable, like fixing typos. Once you accept that contribution, they are then able to trigger workflows with their pull requests. Before making that pull request, they can edit the code of the tests, the workflow, or the rest of the interview to contain malicious code.

You can make those setting more strict [for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#controlling-changes-from-forks-to-workflows-in-public-repositories) and [for organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#configuring-required-approval-for-workflows-from-public-forks). One setting in there makes sure you have to approve triggering workflows each time an outside collaborator makes a pull request.

Private repositories can ignore this since they would first have to share their repository with an outside collaborator, presumably someone they trust. If they do want to collaborate with unfamiliar people, private repositories can also [require approval from forks](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-forks-of-private-repositories).


### GitHub logs and artifacts are public {#github-output}

**This is for any packages that:** run tests in GitHub

On GitHub, workflow job logs and artifacts of public repositories are visible to the public, just like the code. Also, any logged in user can download those workflow artifacts.

That might be fine. Part of being transparent is letting the public understand how your packages are working. Also, there are [some ways](#set-env-var) ALKiln lets you set variables that you want to keep secret. That said, if you are concerned about your logs and artifacts there are some things you can do to make these less available:

- Make your repository private
- [Delete the logs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs#deleting-logs) and [delete the artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/removing-workflow-artifacts).
- [Automatically delete the workflow data sooner](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#setting-the-retention-period-for-a-repository). By default, GitHub keeps them for [90 days](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-retention-period-for-github-actions-artifacts-and-logs-in-your-repository).

<!-- TODO: ALKiln: Allow disabling action logs and artifacts, or sending them to an email instead.

To send job logs from your GitHub Actions workflow to an email, you can use the "Send mail GitHub Action" available in the GitHub Marketplace. This action allows you to send emails with various content types, including plain text, HTML, and even Markdown converted to HTML. It also supports file attachments, which could be useful for including log files.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up the "Send mail GitHub Action" to send job logs via email:

    Add the Action to Your Workflow: First, you need to add the "Send mail GitHub Action" to your GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/your-workflow.yml). You can specify the version of the action you want to use, as shown in the documentation 1.

    Configure the Action: In the workflow file, you'll need to configure the action with the necessary parameters for sending an email. This includes specifying the email server address, port, username, password, subject, body, and recipient email addresses. You can also attach files to the email, such as log files generated during the workflow run.

Here's an example configuration:

- name: Send Email
 uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3.9.0
 with:
    server_address: smtp.example.com
    server_port: 587
    username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
    subject: GitHub Actions Job Log
    body: The job '${{ github.job }}' in workflow '${{ github.workflow }}' of '${{ github.repository }}' has completed.
    to: recipient@example.com
    from: Your Name <your-email@example.com>
    attachments: path/to/your/logfile.log

In this example, replace smtp.example.com, 587, username, password, subject, body, to, from, and attachments with your actual SMTP server details, credentials, email content, and the path to the log file you want to attach.

    Store Secrets: For security reasons, you should store sensitive information like your email username and password as secrets in your GitHub repository. You can do this by going to your repository's "Settings" > "Secrets" and adding the EMAIL_USERNAME and EMAIL_PASSWORD secrets.

    Run Your Workflow: Once you've configured the action and stored your secrets, commit the changes to your workflow file and push them to your repository. The action will then send an email with the specified content and attachments whenever the workflow runs.

Remember, the "Send mail GitHub Action" is provided by a third-party and is governed by separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support documentation 1. Also, consider the privacy and security implications of sending sensitive information via email, especially if your repository is public.

For more complex scenarios or if you need to send emails without needing a Google account, consider using third-party email services like SendGrid or Mailgun, which offer GitHub Actions libraries to simplify sending emails through their APIs 4.

### Protect your default branch {#default-branch}

**This is for any packages that:** have a repository in GitHub

**To do this you MUST be:**

- Either the GitHub repository admin or
- the GitHub organization admin

You can protect your packages from unintended changes or changes by new collaborators by protecting your default branch.

Your default branch is usually called "main". That branch usually has the code that you run on your server and that other packages use. For that reason, many packages [protect their default branch from unexpected changes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches).

For example, you can require that:

- Contributors make new branches when they edit code
- Contributors make a pull request before new code can be added to the main branch
- Administrators have to approve the pull request before that code can be merged

You can allow administrators to skip these restrictions if you want.


### Use GitHub's recommended workflow practices {#workflow}

**This is for any packages that:** have a repository in GitHub

GitHub has documentation about [keeping your GitHub workflows secure](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions). We cover some of that content in here, but you can read that documentation for more.

You can specifically look at [GitHub's recommendations for using third-party actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions), like the ALKiln actions.


## Things to worry about less

There are some security protections that you have automatically.


### Worry less: Your production server {#production}

**This is for:** Everyone

As long as you ensure you [only test on your testing server](#testing-server), ALKiln cannot affect your production server. You will have new files in your package, but they are unable to do anything by themselves.

- The `.feature` files that you have in your "Sources" folder do nothing by themselves. They are as safe as text files.
- The GitHub workflow files can only run on GitHub.


### Worry less: GitHub redacts secrets {#github-redacts-secrets}

**This is for any packages that:** run tests in GitHub

In your GitHub [workflow run console](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows?learn=getting_started#viewing-the-activity-for-a-workflow-run), GitHub redacts any text that matches the values of any of your GitHub secrets. It replaces that text with "\*\*\*". Note that the text must be an exact match. GitHub is unable to recognize partial matches.


### Worry less: <AutoDIY/> tests already freeze your ALKiln version {#playground-version}

**This is for any packages that:** use <AutoDIY/> tests

The ALKiln framework lets you control the robot that goes through your interview answering questions. This documentation has already discussed how [you can freeze your ALKiln framework version on GitHub](#freeze-framework).

[ALKiln itself already uses practices that protect you from malicious actors](#alkilns-precautions). If you want to take extra precautions, though, freezing the version you are using with <AutoDIY/> tests does give you more control over what code you are installing on your server and using to run your tests.

The first page of the <AutoDIY/> interview lets you choose <!-- link to description of that --> the exact version of ALKiln that runs your tests. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time.


## Worry less: You can disable tests {#disable}

If you ever become uncomfortable or concerned about your ALKiln tests, there are [multiple ways you can disable them](setup.mdx#disable).


## ALKiln protects you too {#alkilns-precautions}

Trust is part of how we decide what tools to use. How do you know who to trust? You can ask some questions.

- Who is making and providing the tool?
- What are their economic incentives?
- What are their personal incentives?
- What are their security practices?

Out team takes special precautions with ALKiln's code to ensure you are as safe as we can make you. We are always looking for more ways to improve our security practices.


### ALKlin is limited {#limited}

**This is for:** Everyone

By design, the ALKiln framework is very limited in what it lets a test do. A test can:

- [Interact with interviews](writing_tests.mdx#interact)
- [Sign in](writing_tests.mdx#sign-in) to an account if you give it the email and password
- [Go to whatever site you give it](writing_tests.mdx#go-anywhere), though it is unable to do much on non-docassemble-interview sites
- [Observe things about interview pages](writing_tests.mdx#observe)

With <GTOYS/> tests, ALKiln must have [developer privileges](#alkiln_role) to set up the tests, but the tests themselves are just like an unregistered person online. For other types of test methods - <AutoDIY/> and <KittyLitter/> tests - ALKiln doesn't even need a an account on your docassemble server.


### ALKiln hides environment variables {#alkiln-env-vars}

**This is for:** Everyone

[Environment variables might contain sensitive information](#sensitive-info-playground). Because of this ALKiln takes extra care with them.

<SecureEnvVars/>

It also avoids putting the values of environment variables in logs and reports.

:::danger JSON variables
You do need to [take care when you use JSON Steps](#json-vars).
:::


### ALKiln reports its security updates {#alkiln-logs}

When ALKiln as a security update, we announce it on [docassemble's Slack channel](https://docassemble.org/docs/support.html#slack) and post it in [ALKiln's changelog](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln/blob/-/CHANGELOG.md). The Slack channel is called "#alkiln-automated-testing".

Security updates have the heading "Security". For example, [this is one of ALKiln's security updates](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln/blob/-/CHANGELOG.md#security-1).


### ALKiln freezes the versions of its dependencies {#alkiln-freezes-dependencies}

**This is for:** Everyone

Just like you can freeze the versions of the [ALKiln framework](#freeze-framework) and [ALKiln actions](#freeze-actions), ALKiln freezes the versions of its own dependencies - the libraries it uses. When we update our dependencies to their latest versions, we check the updates and do our best to make sure that we are comfortable with the changes.


### ALKiln updates its dependencies {#alkiln-deps}

**This is for:** Everyone

The ALKiln team checks on the security of ALKiln's dependencies. When a dependency reports a new security improvement, we update ALKiln so it uses that new improvement. Not all dependency fixes are relevant to ALKiln, but it is still good to keep up to date.


### ALKiln protects its major branches {#alkiln-branches}

**This is for:** Everyone

ALKiln protects itself from unintended changes or changes by new collaborators. ALKiln has gotten many volunteer contributions over time and we want to make sure we check that code carefully before we release it to you.

As our documentation described, [you can protect your default branch from changes](#default-branch). ALKiln has multiple branches that users depend on - one branch for every major version. For example, v3, v4, and v5. It protects all those branches in various ways. For example, we:

- Require contributors to make new branches when they edit code
- Require contributors to make a pull request before new code can be added to the main branch
- Require administrators to approve a pull request before that code can be merged so that we have a chance to review it

Our administrators can get past these restrictions. We keep tight control of who our administrators are.


### ALKiln uses good action file practices {#alkiln-action-files}

**This is for any packages that:** run tests in GitHub

ALKiln's action files are very similar to workflow files, like yours. As such, they use the same [GitHub-recommended practices](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions) that your workflows can use.


### You can report an ALKiln security vulnerability {#report}

**This is for:** Everyone

If you find an ALKiln security vulnerability, you can [report it to us privately](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
