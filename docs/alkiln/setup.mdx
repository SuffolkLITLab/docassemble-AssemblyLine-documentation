<!-- TODO: Add a GitHub admins section -->
<!-- TODO: Add full instructions to manually create GitHub files and set secrets for the GitHub methods? I think the setup interview should do that. -->
<!-- TODO:
Should this file include how to run the tests? Workflow files, trigger automatically, on a schedule, manually, tags, ALKiln versions, etc.

The pros and cons sections are already kind of about running the tests. This is separate from providing all the necessary files. Workflow file setup often only happens once per repository when ALKiln things are in working order, but sometimes when new users are getting started they do tweak things for a bit.

On the other hand, instructions for generally running tests should be in the main documentation writing tests file. Those who write tests will also run them and have to deal with that complexity. Things like adding env vars, using tags, running manually, maybe even ALKiln versions.

That is, test-specific secrets might be separate from the SERVER_URL-type secrets. And those might be separate from errors you get when your dev API key changes or gets erased and tests suddenly fail.
-->
<!-- TODO: Workflow section about an action version vs. an alkiln version? -->

This page will tell you about the different ways to set up and run your ALKiln tests. You can install and run ALKiln in different ways and in different environments. You can use as many of these methods as you want.


## Do _I_ need to read this? {#who}

Maybe not. People just writing tests can skip this page. Also, if your package's repository already has a `.github` folder with workflow files you can probably skip this page.

On the other hand, people helping manage GitHub repositories or organizations and people helping manage docassemble servers might find this page useful.

<!--
- People managing GitHub organizations can simplify future ALKiln test setup for their organization's repositories
- People managing GitHub repositories can use this page to install tests in a repository for the first time
- People managing a docassemble server can install ALKiln on that server to run tests in their Playground
 -->

<!--
:::note Draft
Put these in the setup interview too:

- Who should set up tests?
- When do you need to do the setup process?
- When to set up secrets? (don't do secrets if your org already has secrets) <- I think this should just be in the set up interview, not here.

Don't do setup:
- Just writing tests, don't do setup
- If your repo already did setup, you don't need to do setup

<!--
Installing tests can involve one or more of these things:

1. Adding a GitHub workflow file
1. Creating GitHub secrets
1. Installing a package on your docassemble server
 -->

## Types of tests {#types}

There are three kinds of tests:

1. **<GTOYS/>** - GitHub-triggered tests that create and test a Project on your docassemble server
2. **<AutoDIY/>** - Tests that you trigger manually from an interview you install on your docassemble server
3. **<KittyLitter/>**[^sand] - GitHub-triggered tests that create their own docassemble server on GitHub and run tests there

Each type of test has its advantages and disadvantages.

<!--
Every type of test runs on a docassemble server. Option 1 and option 3 both run on GitHub. Sorry about the names. Each type of test has its advantages and disadvantages.


1. GitHub runs these automatically on your docassemble test server. These tests are triggered on GitHub. **(automatic test server tests/auto tests/auto server)**
2. You run manually on your docassemble test server in your account. **(manual test server tests/manual tests/manual server)**
3. GitHub runs these automatically on an isolated GitHub server with docassemble installed. These tests are triggered on GitHub. **(automatic GitHub server tests/weird auto tests/auto remote/auto blackbox/auto isolated/auto fenced/auto sandbox/auto sequestered/~~temporary~~/enclosed/encapsulated/capsule/bounded/restricted/quarantined/restrained/secluded/closeted/lonesome/hermit/hermetic/private.../sealed/clean/blank)** (bounded or enclosed might be used in the text of its section to give it more context "within the bounds of a separate isolated GitHub server")

## Recommended: <GTOYS/> {#recommended}

This is the way we recommend setting up ALKiln tests for a repository for the first time. You are least likely to run into setup problems with this method. Every repository that needs to use this kind of test must go through this setup process.

The tests run whenever you commit any code to any branch on GitHub. You can read more [details and the pros and cons of <GTOYS/> tests](#githubNyou-details) below.

**You need:**

- A developer or admin account on your docassemble server.
- A package with a repository on GitHub.
- A collaborator or admin account on your package's GitHub repository[^edit].

**It could help to know about:**

- Docassemble API keys
- GitHub secrets
- GitHub workflows
- GitHub pull requests (PRs)<!-- **If you use the setup interview, it could help to know about:** -->
- GitHub personal authorization tokens (PATs)

**What to do:**

<GitHubSetup/>

1. Add GitHub secrets to your repository (or organization[^org])
1. Make a new branch in your repository
1. Add new code to that branch, including a new "workflow" file at the very least
1. Make a pull request with that branch

**To run tests:**

1. Pull the new code to your Playground
1. Make a change in one of your files
1. On your Project's "Packages" page, write a commit message and tap to [commit the changes to GitHub](https://docassemble.org/docs/development.html#versioncontrol)
1. Go to the repository in GitHub and tap on the "Actions" tab to see the tests running

:::warning TODO
Add link to going to GitHub "Actions" tab
:::

You can read about [running tests](writing_tests.mdx#github-triggers) in other documentation.


<!-- [^names]: You may have spotted this already, but two of these methods run tests on GitHub. They run the tests in different ways, though. We have not yet found good names for them that avoid this confusion. -->

[^edit]: That is, you need to have the ability to edit the code in your package's GitHub repository. If you own the repository or organization you are an admin and have the correct access level. If someone else is the owner and you are unsure of your access level, ask an admin what permission level you have for the repository. They can check [the repository's collaborators settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository#filtering-the-list-of-teams-and-people).

[^org]: If the repositories you want to test belong to one GitHub organization, get one of the organization's admins to run the ALKiln test setup interview and create organization secrets. They can also [create them manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-an-organization). Each repository the organization has will use those secrets so you don't have to bother adding them to every repository. Otherwise, you have to create the same secrets for each repository and if one of the values changes, you will have to update it in every repository.


## First test {#first-test}

You can add a short test right away that just makes sure your YAML file runs. If you run the setup interview you can choose to create this test at that time and we recommend you do that. If you set up your tests manually instead:

1. In the Playground of your Project, go to the "Sources" folder.
1. Add an file that ends in `.feature`. For example, `interviews_load.feature`.
1. In that file, write `Feature:` at the top, with a description of the general category of tests that will be in that file.
1. Add a `Scenario:` for each interview you want to test. The file should look similar to this:

```
Feature: Interviews load

  Scenario: The 209A loads
    Given I start the interview at "ma_209a_package.yml"

  Scenario: The Plaintiff's Motion to Modify loads
    Given I start the interview at "plaintiffs_motion_to_modify_209a.yml"
```

You can wait to write more complex tests till your code is more stable. "Stable" means that your question block variable names and values should be staying pretty much the same.

You can read more about [the different parts of test files in other documentation](writing_tests.mdx#test-files).

<!-- To run the tests you can commit new code to your GitHub repository or you can [trigger your workflow manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow). Authors usually [commit new code from their Playground](https://docassemble.org/docs/development.html#versioncontrol). -->

## <AutoDIY/> tests {#diy-how-to}

If you set up <AutoDIY/> tests, any developer can run tests on any of their Projects when they are logged into your docassemble test server. You can read more details and the [pros and cons of <AutoDIY/> tests](#diy-details) below.

**You need:**

- A developer or admin account on your docassemble server.
- A Project with at least one ALKiln test in it. It can just be that [first test](#first-test).

:::warning TODO:
Add a link to adding a test to a project
:::

**It helps to know about:**

- Installing GitHub packages on your docassemble server
- Adding interviews to your docassemble server's configuration's dispatch list

**What to do:**

1. Make sure you are logged into your docassemble server.
1. Go to your server's ["Package Management" page](https://docassemble.org/docs/packages.html#installing).
1. [Use GitHub to install](https://docassemble.org/docs/packages.html#github_install) the [ALKilnInThePlayground package](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-ALKilnInThePlayground) from its `main` branch.
1. Follow [docassemble's instructions](https://docassemble.org/docs/config.html#dispatch) to add it to the dispatch list. This will add it to the server's list of interviews. It may look something like this:

```yml
dispatch:
  alkiln: docassemble.ALKilnInThePlayground:data/questions/run_alkiln_tests.yml
  # Your other server interviews
```

4. Go to your server's list of ["Available interviews"](https://docassemble.org/docs/admin.html#available%20interviews). ALKiln's package should now be listed there.
1. Run that interview.
1. On the first page of that interview, choose to install the latest version of ALKiln by picking the top item in the list. You can choose to do this whenever we make a new version of ALKiln. Tap to continue.

:::warning TODO
Add images of picking new version
Add section in reminders about updating docassemble server (InPlayground) to new version of ALKiln
:::

**To run the tests:**

1. Make sure you are logged into your docassemble server.
1. Run the ALKiln interview from your server's list of available interviews.
1. Skip the first page by just tapping to continue.
1. From the list of projects, pick a Project that already has tests in its Sources folder. If it has no tests, read how to add tests in our documentation then start with step number 1 again.
1. Run the tests and see the output.

:::warning TODO:
- Above, add link to how to make test files
- Above, add link to info about test output
- Figure out where to add details, like tags, etc.
:::

<!--
1. Optionally, if you have added "tags" to your tests using [the tag expression syntax](https://www.cuketest.com/en/cucumber/tag-expressions), you can use a tag expression to limit which tests you run. -->


## <KittyLitter/> tests (advanced) {#sandbox-how-to}

<KittyLitter/> tests are the most secure because they never interact with your server. ALKiln makes a server on GitHub itself and runs the tests there.

Every repository that needs to use this kind of test must go through this setup process.

This is an advanced method and may not work for everyone. We are happy to help you with it.

The tests run whenever you commit any code to any branch on GitHub. You can read more details and the [pros and cons of <KittyLitter/> tests](#sandbox-details) below.

**You need:**

- A package with a repository on GitHub.
- A collaborator or admin account on your package's GitHub repository[^edit].

**It helps to know about:**

- Editing files on GitHub
- GitHub workflows
- GitHub pull requests (PRs)

**What to do:**

1. Sign in to the package's GitHub repository.
1. Make a new branch. The name doesn't matter. We often call it `alkiln_tests`.
1. Tap the choice to add a new file to the repository. You can do this on GitHub or on your own computer.
1. In the field for the file's name, enter this text: `.github/workflows/some_name.yml`. You can give the file whatever name you want as long as it is in those folders and ends with `.yml`.
1. This is your workflow file. Copy [ALKiln's own workflow file](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln/blob/v5/.github/workflows/github_server.yml). Read the notes in that file to see what you need to change. You should pay attention to the notes that start with `#### Developer note` and follow those instructions.
1. Commit this file to GitHub.
1. In the same branch, navigate to your package's "sources" folder. These are the folders to get there: `docassemble/<YourPackageName>/data/sources`.
1. Add a new file here too. This will be your first test. You might call it `interviews_load.feature`, but it can be anything that ends in `.feature`.
1. Copy our example of a [first test](#first-test) into that file.
1. Commit that file.
1. Go to the repository's [Actions page to see the test running](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#viewing-the-workflows-activity).
1. If the tests pass, make a pull request with that branch. If not, troubleshoot the tests.

:::warning TODO

Add link to troubleshooting page
:::

<!--
First follow the regular instructions to set up for GitHub. The difference here is that you can skip setting up repository or organization secrets. If you already have those secrets, leave them as they are. They have nothing to do with this.

<GitHubSetup/>

1. Make a new branch in your repository
1. Add new code to that branch, including a new "workflow" file at the very least
1. Make a pull request with that branch

Then edit the new workflow to look like  -->

**To run tests:**

1. Pull the repository's new code to your Playground
1. Make a change in one of your files
1. On your Project's "Packages" page, write a commit message and tap to [commit the changes to GitHub](https://docassemble.org/docs/development.html#versioncontrol)
1. Go to that package's repository in GitHub and [go to the "Actions" page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#viewing-the-workflows-activity) to see the tests running

You can also run the tests by [triggering your workflow manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow).

<!-- TODO: Add link to running tests in writing_tests.mdx -->

<!-- Read more about GitHub <KittyLitter/> test options here. -->


## <GTOYS/> test details {#githubNyou-details}

<!-- TODO: "on your test server" with a link to security section -->
These tests run on GitHub, but they still interact with a Project they create on your server.
You can read about [running tests](writing_tests.mdx#github-triggers) in other documentation.


### What is ALKiln doing? {#githubNyou-how}

When you run <GTOYS/> tests, ALKiln does the following:

1. ALKiln goes to the testing account you set up on your server and creates a new Project. If you log into that account, you'll be able to see the new Project in the list of projects.
1. It uploads the relevant branch of your package into the Project.
1. For each <!--(`Scenario` or `Scenario Outline` and row in an `Examples` table)--> test, ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to the url of that Project's interview (whatever interview you named in the test).
1. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test.
1. When all the tests are done, ALKiln deletes the Project it created.

You can see the tests running on your repository's [GitHub Actions page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#viewing-the-workflows-activity).

When the tests are done, you can see a report and logs right in the [workflow's "job" page on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs). You can also [download a `.zip` file on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts) containing all the results of the tests to your computer.

:::warning TODO
Add link to section on test results
:::

[GitHub quota limits](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration) probably will not be a problem, especially not for public repositories.

<!-- ## Workflow file for <GTOYS/> tests {#githubNyou-workflow-file} -->

<!-- Should the below be just in the setup interview? It seems like it should be here too, but that doubles up on information location. I _would_ really like to avoid duplication if possible, especially about the specific contents of the workflow files, which already has to be in the setup interview. -->

<!-- Each package should have its own workflow file. It should be in your package's `.github` folder in your GitHub repository. That file triggers the tests to run and uses ALKiln to run them.

GitHub also calls this an "action". Their language around this is confusing. We use "workflow" to talk about your package's GitHub code. We use "action" to talk about ALKiln's GitHub files - the ones your workflow uses.

When you run the setup interview, it adds files to your repository. The GitHub workflow file is one of them. This section is about a package's workflow file specifically and how you can customize it.

There are many things a GitHub workflow can do. This documentation focuses on only the features default ALKiln workflows use. GitHub documentation talks about all the details.

- GitHub workflow file parts
- GitHub workflow additional capabilities

### Pros {#githubNyou-pros}

- ALKiln on GitHub will test any changes any team member commits. In <AutoDIY/> tests, you only test your changes.
- On GitHub, there are ways to schedule tests to run regularly - every week, every day, or whatever schedule you prefer. If packages you depend on change and break your code, those tests will let you know.
- If you've forgotten to add a file to the package that an interview depends on (like a missing template file), GitHub will catch that. It installs the file fresh in a new Project, so it only has the files that have been committed properly.
- You can continue editing files in your Playground other than python files while the GitHub tests run because GitHub creates a whole new Project of its own.
- You can configure your GitHub "action" to do other things, like create GitHub issues whenever tests fail.
<!-- - TODO: Package size because of `dainstall`? -->
<!-- [The <AutoDIY/> tests may also keep running. Have to test this out before adding this item] - If your server reloads during the test run, a few individual tests may fail, but ALKiln will still be able to continue and keep trying to run the rest of the tests. That is because the test code is in running from GitHub, so your reload doesn't stop that process. -->


### Cons {#githubNyou-cons}

For everyone:

- Setting this test up in more reliable, but also more complex than the other methods. Setting them up on your own requires admin access to the repository and the docassemble server and an understanding of the correct files and of GitHub secrets. The [ALKiln test setup interview](https://apps-dev.suffolklitlab.org/start/test-setup) tries to help with that and even people with developer access can do it, but it is complex in its own ways.
- Your tests might be more flaky. That means they may fail for reasons that don't have to do with the interviews. For example, if your tests are running while your server is reloading, ALKiln will keep running, so other tests will still have an opportunity to continue, but individual tests may fail even if your code is correct. Your server can reload for many reasons - updating your config, installing a new package, etc. When tests fail meaninglessly, it slows down your development cycle and sometimes people end up turning off the tests instead of dealing with the complexity.

For some people:

- If you have `restrict input variables` set to `True` in your server's config and have signature screens in the interview you are testing, you *must* have the trigger variable HTML in your interview for signatures.
<!-- - TODO: package size? From experiments, it seems to not be a problem -->

## <AutoDIY/> test details {#diy-details}

You run these tests yourself from an ALKiln interview you install on your own docassemble development server or test server.

:::warning TODO
Add link to security section about not testing on production.
:::


### What is ALKiln doing? {#diy-how}

When you log into your docassemble server account and run <AutoDIY/> tests, ALKiln does the following:

:::warning TODO
Add link to running the tests
:::

1. For each <!--(`Scenario` or `Scenario Outline` and row in an `Examples` table)--> test, ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to the url of the Project and interview you specified.
1. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test.

When the tests are done, you will see a page with the output of the tests which you will also be able to download.

:::warning TODO
Link to description of results/output
:::

### Pros {#diy-pros}

- You can skip putting your package on GitHub.
- Running ALKiln on your server lets you loop through your development cycle faster - edit, test, edit, test. You don't have to go through committing your code to GitHub every time.
- You can more easily limit your tests to a specific set of tests using [tag expressions](https://www.cuketest.com/en/cucumber/tag-expressions). You can use tags on GitHub too, it just takes more steps.
- The full report output is easier to get right away.
- If you also have GitHub tests, running <AutoDIY/> tests before you commit can often help you avoid the red "x" that appears next to failing tests on GitHub. The red "x" is a useful piece of information, but it can be uncomfortable.


### Cons {#diy-cons}

For everyone:

- You cannot edit the Project that the test is testing.
- You will miss catching some kinds of mistakes. ["File not found" errors](troubleshooting.mdx#file-not-found) can come up because of this.
- Your tests can be more flaky. For example, if your server reloads while the tests are running, the tests may get unexpected results. You may have to start the tests all over again.

For some people:

- If you are using a docassemble Docker image created before April 9th, 2023, you will have to do a ["system upgrade"](https://docassemble.org/docs/docker.html#upgrading) to update your server to a newer docassemble Docker image. Any version of https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble-os that is older than 1.0.8 uses versions of `node` that are too old for ALKiln. As of February 11th, 2024, ALKiln is using node version 18. A lot of people have upgraded already and it is a very good idea to do that, for security at the very least. If you do need to upgrade, though, you need to back up all your data, delete your old image and container, get the new image, create a new container, and restore your data. It may sound simple, but it is a tricky process.
- If you have `restrict input variables` set to `True` in your server's config and have signature screens in the interview you are testing, you *must* have the trigger variable HTML in your interview for signatures.

## <KittyLitter/> test details {#sandbox-details}

<KittyLitter/> tests are the most secure because they never interact with your server and the isolated server they each create is temporary. Unfortunately, these tests also sometimes have more setup complications.

You can read about [running tests](writing_tests.mdx#github-triggers) in other documentation.

### What is ALKiln doing? {#sandbox-how}

When you run <KittyLitter/> tests, ALKiln does the following:

1. ALKiln creates a server on GitHub itself.
1. It installs the relevant branch of your package on that server.
1. For each <!--(`Scenario` or `Scenario Outline` and row in an `Examples` table)--> test, ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to the url of the interview named in the test.
1. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test.
1. When all the tests are done, the GitHub server gets deleted.

You can see the tests running on your repository's [GitHub Actions page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#viewing-the-workflows-activity).

When the tests are done, you can see a report and logs right in the [workflow's "job" page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs) or [download a `.zip` file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts) containing all the results of the tests to your computer.

:::warning TODO
Add link to section on test results
:::

[GitHub quota limits](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration) probably will not be a problem, especially not for public repos.


### Pros {#sandbox-pros}

- All the [same advantages as regular GitHub tests](#githubNyou-pros) as well as some additional ones.
- This is the most secure of all the methods. The tests don't interact with your server at all.
- You can edit whatever files you want on your own server.
- In some cases, no GitHub secrets are necessary.
- Your tests will generally be less flaky. When a test fails it's more likely to be a problem with your code instead of a problem with the server, giving you better information. That's because the server is isolated, or "sandboxed"[^sand], on GitHub and no one is going to make that sandboxed server reload in the middle of the tests.
- You do not have to set up or update any docassemble API keys or GitHub tokens.
- I might be useful to test [Custom data types](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#custom%20datatype) on a sandboxed server. A docassemble CustomDatatype affects a whole server. Testing it on a sandboxed server means it cannot affect the CustomDatatypes that are already on your server.
<!-- - [Not faster enough to note, I think, and only under some circumstances, like downloading files. Also depends on how much memory they give their server.] Can be a bit faster  -->


### Cons {#sandbox-cons}

For everyone:

- Tests take about 5-10 minutes longer since they have to do things like create a docker container and start a server.
- The GitHub server installs the latest version of docassemble, which might be a different version than the one you use on your production server. Any server other than your production server will be different in some ways, though, and you should never run these tests on your production server.
- In most cases, you should avoid hard-coded urls that go to your server. That is, avoid using `https://my-server.com` and interviews or other pages there. That will send the tests to your server, which makes them less secure again.

For some people:

- At this time, <KittyLitter/> tests are unable to handle data stored externally. For example, data stored in an S3 bucket.<!--  If you still want this type of test, it is more work. You are welcome to use [our GitHub action code](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln/blob/v5/action_for_github_server/action.yml) as a starting point, of course, to write your own GitHub action to create a server on GitHub with the right Docker build environment variables, S3 credentials, and config details from your dev server. -->
- You **must** make sure you have properly required all your "Dependencies" on your Packages page. That is the only way the isolated/sandboxed[^sand] server can know to download them.
- All your package's dependencies **must** be published on pypi. That is the only place that the sandboxed server can get them.
<!-- - TODO: Package size because of `dainstall`? -->


<!-- ## Workflow file for <KittyLitter/> tests {#sandbox-workflow-file} -->

<!-- Should the below be just in the setup interview? It seems like it should be here too, but that doubles up on information location.

- GitHub workflow security
- GitHub workflow file parts
- GitHub workflow additional capabilities

1. Leave your other workflow secrets alone. Note, your `DOCASSEMBLE_DEVELOPER_API_KEY` and `SERVER_URL` do not need to be on the same server as your `CONFIG_CONTENTS`.
1. Make a new workflow file so that it is similar to [ALKiln's own workflow file](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/ALKiln/blob/v5/.github/workflows/github_server.yml). If you want to stop old tests from running, delete your old workflow file.
1. Read the notes in that file to see what you need to change to adapt the file for your project. Each of the notes is marked with `#### Developer note`.
1. Commit the changes.

:::caution
To use this method, avoid using hard-coded urls to go to a test interview. That is, avoid using `https://my-server.com` to navigate to interviews or other server pages. That will send the tests to your server.

If you need to troubleshoot the docker setup because the step to start the GitHub server keeps failing, you can make the docker startup logs visible and allow ALKiln to create an artifact of the docker installation logs. Do this by passing the input `SHOW_DOCKER_OUTPUT` to ALKiln's GitHub server action, like our script (linked above) does for itself. The input arguments might look like the below:

```yml
        with:
          CONFIG_CONTENTS: "${{ secrets.CONFIG_CONTENTS }}"
          SHOW_DOCKER_OUTPUT: true
```

It's possible to do more docker troubleshooting using [the tmate action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/debugging-with-tmate). You can see code for that in our workflow file as well.
