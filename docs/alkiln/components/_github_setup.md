Use [ALKiln's test setup interview](https://apps-dev.suffolklitlab.org/start/test-setup) to add ALKiln to your repository. You must run this setup interview for every package you want to test on GitHub.

:::warning TODO: add link for adding tests later
When you set up, you can choose to create your [first test](#first-test). We recommend that you do this. Either way, you can add more tests later.

This setup interview can take over 30 minutes, especially if you're unfamiliar with GitHub or with docassemble API keys. To summarize, the instructions in the interview will help you:

<!--
  GitHub will run your first test. You can then see the results of that workflow [See the results](#see-github-test-results) and merge that PR
-->

<!-- You can read link: more about workflow files in the reference documentation. -->
