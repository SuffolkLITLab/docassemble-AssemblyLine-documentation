Use [ALKiln's test setup interview](https://apps-dev.suffolklitlab.org/start/test-setup) to add ALKiln to your repository. You must run this setup interview for every package you want to test on GitHub.

:::warning TODO: add link for adding tests
When you set up, you can choose to create your [first test](#first-test). We recommend that you do this. Either way, you can add more tests later.
:::

This setup interview can take over 30 minutes, especially if you're unfamiliar with GitHub and docassemble API keys. The instructions there will help you. To summarize, you will:

1. Add GitHub secrets to your repository (or organization[^org_setup])
1. Make a new branch in your repository
1. Add new code to that branch, including a new "workflow" file at the very least
1. Make a pull request with that branch

<!--
  GitHub will run your first test. You can then see the results of that workflow [See the results](#see-github-test-results) and merge that PR
-->

<!-- You can read link: more about workflow files in the reference documentation. -->
