This page describes your tests files and how to write tests <!-- , run tests, -->  and other useful information. To see the table of contents on a small screen, tap on the dropdown menu at the top of the page. To see it on a wider screen, see the column on the right-hand side of the screen.


## Do _I_ need to read this? {#who}

If you are writing tests <!-- , running tests, --> or need to learn about test files, this page is for you.


## Quick refresher {#refresh}

1. You can see [what your first test might look like](setup.mdx#first-test).
1. You can generate a more complex test with the help of the [ALKiln Story Table Step generator](https://github.com/plocket/alkiln_story).
1. Every time you change or add a required variable, you must update the tests that need that variable.
1. You write and edit `.feature` test files in your Sources folder.
1. You can check the syntax of your test file by using an editor like the [editor at AssertThat](https://www.assertthat.com/online-gherkin-editor).
1. If you are using GitHub tests, those tests will run when anyone commits to GitHub.
1. By default, each Step or page **must** be completed in at most 30 seconds. You can change that with the "the maximum seconds" Step listed in the Steps.
1. ALKiln creates test reports and pictures. For example, ALKiln saves pictures and the HTML of pages that showed errors In GitHub, they are in the zip file in [your workflow's artifact section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts).
1. There are some field types that ALKiln cannot yet handle, including some `object`-type fields.

<!-- The tests use the [gherkin language and syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) -->

Here is an example of a more complex test for a quick refresher on some of our features:

```gherkin
@children
Feature: I have children

@fast @child_benefits
Scenario: child has benefits
  Given I start the interview at "some_file_name.yml"
  And I get to the question id "benefits" with this data:
    | var | value | trigger |
    | children.there_are_any | True |
    | children.target_number | 2 |
    | children[0].name.first | Cashmere |
    | children[0].name.last | Davis |
    | children[1].name.first | Casey |
    | children[1].name.last | Davis |
  When I set the var "benefits['SSI']" to "True"
  And I tap to continue
  Then the question id should be "download"
  And I download "some_motion.pdf"
```


## Writing test Steps overview {#steps}

Most of [the code in test files](#files) is code for ALKiln Steps.

ALKiln Steps are how you give your instructions to the ALKiln robot. Steps are made of commands[^meh] that ALKiln has created for you. Those commands often need information from you. They are like fill-in-the-blank sentences. A sort of [madlibs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs#format) for your ALKiln robot. For example:

```gherkin
  And I set the variable "likes_bears" to "True"
```

This Step is made of three parts.

1. `And` is one of the keywords that can start a Step
1. `I set the variable "___" to "___"` is an ALKiln command with blanks that you need to fill in
1. `likes_bears` and `True` are the information you put in the blanks so that the ALKiln robot knows what answer to give to a question

That command can also be written as `I set the variable "<variable name>" to "<value>"`. This tells you what information you should put in each of these blanks. In this case there are two blank spaces you should fill. In the first blank, you are supposed to put the name of the variable that the field will set. In the second blank, you are supposed to put the value that you want the variable to have.

Each of your tests - a `Scenario` or a `Scenario Outline` - usually contains many Steps. Any Step can be used as many times as you want and at any point in a test.


[^meh] We are still working finding a more descriptive name. Suggestions are welcome.


## Interactive Steps {#interact}

You can use some Steps to change what is on the page by filling in fields, pressing buttons or tabs, or performing other actions.


### The Story Table Step {#story-table}

The Story Table Step fills in fields on interview pages. It is the Step many of our authors work with the most. In our opinion, in most cases it is the most effective and flexible way to fill in fields in your forms. This makes the test easier to maintain.

The data in the table is a snapshot of the user who is filling out the form. It has this format:

```gherkin
  And I get to the question id "<target question id>" with this data:
    | var | value |
    | <variable name> | <value to set> |
    | <variable name> | <value to set> |
```

This Step is made of a sentence followed by a table. The table **must** have two columns with the headings `var` and `value`. There are three types of blanks you need to fill in for this Step: `<target question id>`, `<variable name>`, `<value to set>`.

Each row of the table is one variable in the interview. On each page, ALKiln:

1. Checks if the page has the `<target question id>` you gave it at the start
1. If the page does have the `<target question id>` it stops the Step
1. Otherwise, it looks at each `<variable name>` in the `var` column to see if it can find that name in any fields
1. For each `<variable name>` it finds, it tries to answer the field using the matching `<value to set>`
1. It tries to continue to the next page
1. If it is unable to continue it logs an error and stops
1. Otherwise, it repeats the above

An example table:

```gherkin
  And I get to the question id "brought scissors" with this data:
    | var | value |
    | last_haircut_date | today - 730 |
    | wants_virtual_haircut | True |
    | user_name | Jared |
    | intro_screen_accepts_terms | True |
```

:::tip Docs
Filling in checkboxes is tricky. Check our [documentation about setting checkbox values](#checkboxes).
:::

This Step is flexible, which makes the test easier to maintain. The order of the rows is unimportant. That means you can edit the order of your pages or move fields to different pages without worrying about breaking the test.

ALKiln sets a table variable every time it finds that variable on a page, no matter how many times that variable appears.

You can use multiple Story Tables in a test.

Right now, Story Tables are unable to [use environment variables to fill in answers](#env-vars).

:::warning Unused rows
The Story Table does not care about extra rows that never get used. This can make Story Tables easier to write, but it also means that the tests will technically "pass" even if variables that *should* get set are never filled in.

That can be a sign that a question that the user *should* have seen got skipped or that there is a typo or mistake in the test.

Because of this, the ALKiln report shows a list of unused rows for each table. You can check the report of passing tests to make sure none of the important rows got skipped.

## Steps to start tests {#start}

There are some Steps that can be, and often are, the first Step in a test. They can still be used multiple times and at any point in the test. Your test **must** start with one of these Steps.

...


### `I start the interview at "<YAML file name>"` {#start-interview}

Use this Step to start a new session of an interview.


### `The maximum time for a Step is <number> seconds` {#custom-timeout}

...


### `I wait for <number> seconds` {#wait}

...


## Observational Steps {#observe}

You can use some Steps to look at what is on the page or compare data. You can use these to make sure the interview has done what you want it to.


### `I SHOULD see the phrase "<page text>"` {#phrase}


## Understanding test results {#output}

...


## Test file anatomy {#files}

Your tests files have the code that tells ALKiln how to answer questions in your interview and do other things. The code may look different than other code you have seen, but it is still code. It is still rigid and needs you to use the right syntax and spelling.

You should save your test files in your package's ["Sources" folder](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#sources). If you used the ALKiln setup interview, there will already be a test there that just loads the interview.

In test files, you use [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) syntax and keywords[^keywords] with [specific "Steps" that the ALKiln framework has created](#steps) for docassemble interviews.

[^keywords] Keywords are specific words that have a special meaning and purpose when you use them in specific places in your test code. They are similar to the words `else` and `not` in python.

Here are some rules about test files:

- You can have as many test files as you want.
- Each file can have one or more tests, called Scenarios or Scenario Outlines.
- Each file's name **must** end in `.feature` because that is the extension of that type of file. For example, `user_has_children.feature`.
- Each file **must** start with the keyword `Feature:` or a tag followed by a new line and the `Feature:` keyword.
- Each file **must** contain only one `Feature:` keyword.
- You **must** use **Gherkin** syntax for your tests. [Gherkin's own documentation](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) is the best place to read about Gherkin syntax with some exceptions that you can read below. Ignore notes about "step definitions". Those are part of what ALKiln takes care of.

To troubleshoot Gherkin synatx problems <!-- TODO: Add link to errors that indicate incorrect syntax. Wrong cell count, etc. --> in your tests, use an editor like the one at [AssertThat](https://www.assertthat.com/online-gherkin-editor). It will mark lines that have incorrect syntax. For example, the editor should mark an extra `Feature:` keyword as incorrect.

ALKiln only allows you to use some Gherkin keywords. Those are:

- [`Feature:`](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#feature) - each file can only use one `Feature:` keyword.
- [`Scenario:`/`Example:`](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#example) - We recommend you use `Scenario`. **Make the `Scenario` descriptions unique** because ALKiln will use them in the names of the reports it creates for you. This keyword is different from the plural `Examples`/`Scenarios`.
- [`Scenario Outline:`](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#scenario-outline)
- [`Examples:/Scenarios:`](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#examples) - We recommend you use `Examples`. This can help you test translations, as shown below. When a `Scenario Outline` has an `Examples` table, the test will run at least once for each row in the table. This keyword is different from the singular `Scenario`/`Example`.
- Theses keywords that can start a Step - [`Given`](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#given), [`When`](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#when), [`Then`](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#then), and [`And`](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#and).

ALKiln also lets you use:

- `@` ([Tags](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/?lang=java#tags)). The specific sections of the tags documentation that apply to ALKiln are:
  - A [general description of tags](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/?lang=java#tags).
  - [Tag expressions](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/?lang=java#tag-expressions)
  - Extra: [Tag inheritance](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/?lang=java#tag-inheritance).
- `#` (Comments). They are a tiny bit different than python comments. They always have to be on their own line. The line can begin with zero or more spaces. You can use comments anywhere in your test file.
- `|` ([Data tables](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#data-tables)).
- `"""` ([Doc strings](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#doc-strings)).

We usually write test text as if it is from the perspective of the user. For example, "I wait" and "I start".

Here is an example of a file that uses most of these features. The name of this file is `children.feature`.

``` gherkin
@has_children
Feature: I have children

# This Scenario uses the Story Table Step. It lets you list the names of
# the variables in any order you want.
@disallow_visitation
Scenario: I disallow visitation
  Given I go to the interview at "protective_order.yml"
  And I get to the question id "what kind of visitation?" with this data:
    | var | value |
    | needs_allow_visitation | False |
    | user_name | Jordan |
    | user_has_children | True |
  Then I should see the phrase "Jordan"

# This test will run once for each row in the `Examples` table. The text
# between the "<" and ">" is the name of a column in the `Examples` table.
@allow_visitation
Scenario Outline: I allow visitation
  Given I go to the interview at "<url>"
  Then I should see the phrase "<name>"
  When I set "user_name" to "Rea"
  And I tap to continue
  Then I should see the phrase "<greeting> Rea!"
  And I set "user_has_children" to "True"
  And I tap to continue
  When I set "needs_allow_visitation" to "True"
  Then I should see see the phrase "This form can help you with that"

  Examples:
    | url | name | greeting |
    | protective_order.yml | Your name | Hello |
    | protective_order.yml&lang=es | Tu nombre | Holá |
```


<!--
Does this section need more details?

Each file has
...
1. One or more `Scenario` or `Scenario Outline` keywords followed by a colon (`:`) and a space and then a short text description of the purpose of that specific test.

Feature
Each `Feature` keyword **must** be followed by a colon (`:`) and a space and then a short text description of the purpose of the tests in the file. For example, `Feature: The user has children`.
Each `Feature` can have zero or more **tags** on the line above it.

Scenario
Each `Scenario` **must** have one or more **Steps**.
Each `Scenario` can have zero or more **tags** on the line above it.

Scenario Outline
1. Can have zero or more `Examples` tables. (Can it really have multiple `Examples`? If so, we should warn that this will cause tons of tests because the number of tests is factorial or something like that.)

Each **Step** **must** start with one of these keywords:
1. `Given`
1. `Then`
1. `When`
1. `And`
You can use any of those. It does not matter what you pick.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) {#faq}

### Do I have to set every variable in the interview? {#every-var}

No, only required variables.


### Checkboxes {#checkboxes}

<!-- Maybe this section should go in the "I set the var" section and/or the Story Table section. It might need to be in all three places. This is such a common problem. If we didn't have to account for `False`, I'd say ALKiln should handle the way everyone seems to intuitively set checkboxes -->

Many authors find setting checkboxes confusing and often use [an incorrect variable name or value](troubleshooting.mdx#reference-not-found).

An example of a checkbox field:

```yml
fields:
  - Out of all your friends, choose your best friends: best_friends
    datatype: checkboxes
    choices:
      - Emmet
      - Maria
      - Sam
```

Many authors make a mistake and try to set this field.

<span class="negative">Wrong</span> ways to set the value:

```gherkin
    And I set the variable "best_friends" to "Emmet"
```

or, in a Story Table:

```gherkin
      | var | value |
      | best_friends | Emmet |
```

<span class="positive">**Right**</span> ways:

```gherkin
    And I set the variable "best_friends['Emmet']" to "True"
```

or, in a Story Table:

```gherkin
      | var | value |
      | best_friends['Emmet'] | True |
```

Note these facts:

- The only values a checkbox can have are `True` or `False`.
- The variable name of the checkbox for ALKiln is very similar, but not the same as, its docassemble variable name. For example, `good_fruits['Apples']`.
- `object_checkboxes` are a common problem. With checkbox choices created with objects, it can be hard to tell what variable name to use. Their names are a bit different than their docassemble version. The variable name here needs extra quotes. For example, look at this field:

```yml
fields:
  - Out of all your friends, choose your best friends: best_friends
    datatype: object_checkboxes
    choices: all_friends
```

<span class="negative">Wrong</span> ways to set the value:

```gherkin
    And I set the variable "best_friends" to "all_friends"
    And I set the variable "best_friends" to "all_friends[0]"
    And I set the variable "best_friends[all_friends[0]]" to "True"
```

or, in a Story Table:

```gherkin
      | var | value |
      | best_friends | all_friends |
      | best_friends | all_friends[0] |
      | best_friends[all_friends[0]] | True |
```

<span class="positive">**Right**</span> ways:

```gherkin
    And I set the variable "best_friends['all_friends[0]']" to "True"
```

or, in a Story Table:

```gherkin
      | var | value |
      | best_friends['all_friends[0]'] | True |
```
