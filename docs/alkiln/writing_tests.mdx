This page describes your tests files and how to write tests. It contains a lot of information. To see the table of contents on a narrow screen, tap on the dropdown menu at the top of the page. To see it on a desktop, see the column on the right-hand side of the screen.

## Quick refresher

See a first test here...

Generate a more complex test with [alkiln_story](https://github.com/plocket/alkiln_story)...

Example of a complex test:

```gherkin
Feature: ...

Scenario: ...

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) {#faq}

### Checkboxes {#faq-checkbox-values}

<!-- Maybe this section should go in the "I set the var" section and/or the Story Table section. It might need to be in all three places. This is such a common problem. If we didn't have to account for `False`, I'd say ALKiln should handle the way everyone seems to intuitively set checkboxes -->

- The only values a checkbox can have are `True` or `False`.
- The variable name of the checkbox for ALKiln is just like its docassemble variable name. For example, `good_fruits['Apples']`.
- `object_checkboxes` are a common problem. With checkbox choices created with objects, it can be hard to tell what variable name to use. For example, look at this field:

```yml
fields:
  - Out of your friends, choose your best friends: best_friends
    datatype: object_checkboxes
    choices: friends
```

Setting an option for the above would look something like this:

```
      | best_friends['friends[0]'] | True |  |
```

These are incorrect things people have tried:

```
      | best_friends | friends[0] |  |
      | best_friends | friends |  |
      | best_friends[friends[0]] | True |  |
```

<!-- ### Only run one test with tags. Here or in setup in the future section about running tests? -->
