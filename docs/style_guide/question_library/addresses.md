## What addresses are for

Address information serves two unrelated purposes on most legal forms:

- Providing a place to send official court notices and receive service of
  process
- Determining eligibility and venue

Determine which purpose is served by the address question on your form. In
particular, if you have both purposes, be aware that your users may have
different domiciles and mailing addresses.

## Ask for addresses in parts

Most PDF forms ask for an address in multiple labeled parts. Addresses are also
often used to determine eligibility, which requires separating zip code or city
name from the rest of the address. There is no 100% reliable programmatic way to
break a single-line address field into parts, so best practice is to ask for the
address in parts in your interview.

### Allow user to specify country if appropriate

If your users commonly may provide addresses from a different country, 
show a country dropdown. Store the country with the ISO country code.

Ideally, update fields to match at least the most common countries, by
updating labels like `Zip code` to `Postal code` and replacing 
`State` with the appropriate label for that country.

## Allow the user to provide a separate mailing address

If both residence and mailing address are important, make sure to ask for both,
and ask a clear question that prompts the user for the correct information.

It is appropriate to offer the user's home address as a default for their
mailing address.

`ALIndividual` objects in the Assembly Line framework have a predefined
`mailing_address` attribute.

## Getting the address of someone who is experiencing homelessness

Some users may be un-homed. Getting the address of a user who does not have a
traditional home can be tricky. Consider fallback solutions that gracefully
handle situations where an individual:

- lacks a permanent address
- is "couch surfing" or staying with a friend
- living in a homeless shelter
- is sleeping outside
- is otherwise experiencing homelessness

Note that many unhoused people **do** have a place that they receive mail. It might
be:

- a friend or family member
- a local homeless shelter 
- a PO Box or non-traditional box (such as at Mailboxes, Etc.)
- [general delivery](https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery) at
  the local post office

For people with these common solutions, the traditional address question above
may be sufficient.

### Determine the purpose of collecting the address

When designing your address question, it is important to know whether the
address is being collected to provide a place to send official correspondence or
to determine eligibility or venue.

For eligibility and venue, knowing the city and state is usually enough. People
without a traditional home still stay in a city and state. **Note**: someone who
is unhoused may be more likely to use a mailing address that is not in the same
venue as their physical location.

There may be special circumstances where more information is required for
determining venue or eligibility. For example, Dana Chisnell of the United
States Digital Service Agency
[reports](https://twitter.com/danachis/status/1557180760410492929) that they
allow people without a traditional address to mark a map indicating the
intersection where they can normally be found.

If the address is being used for official correspondence, decide how to handle
the fact that some users just will not have a traditional address to receive
correspondence.

### Ask for a city, state, and a written explanation

```      

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Vanilla Docassemble" label="Vanilla Docassemble">

---

question: |
  What is your address?
subquestion: |
  Write the address where you live.
fields:
  - I do not have an address: person.address.has_no_address
    datatype: yesno
  - Is there anything else you want to say about your living situation?: person.address.no_address_explanation
    datatype: area
    required: False
    rows: 2
    show if: person.address.has_no_address
    help: |
      Explain your address circumstances. Example: "I usually stay at the corner
      of Fifth and Main St."
  - Street address: person.address.address
    address autocomplete: True
    hide if: person.address.has_no_address
  - Unit: person.address.unit
    required: False
    hide if: person.address.has_no_address
  - City: person.address.city
  - State: person.address.state
    code: |
      states_list()
    default: MA      
  - Zip: person.address.zip
    required: False
    hide if: person.address.has_no_address
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Use `person.address.has_no_address` as a trigger, not `person.address.address`

If you need to accommodate users without a traditional address, use the variable
`person.address.has_no_address` as a trigger in your interview order block,
instead of `person.address.address`.

### Come up with a strategy for placing the alternative address on the form

Most forms have two lines for an address--a line for apartment, street number and
street name, and a separate line for the city, state, and zip code.

If you use the 3-part input described above, you can put the explanation on line
1 and fill in the city and state as normal, leaving the zip code blank.

Make sure the user knows the character limit for this line on the form. Consider
providing an addendum.

If you use the Assembly Line framework, the following methods are all "aware" of the 
variation on an address that handle un-homed individuals, and you do not need
any special logic in the template file or attachment block:

- address.block()
- address_block()
- address.on_one_line()
- address.line_one()
- address.line_two()

## Handling international addresses

Court forms usually require that one or both litigants in the action reside in
the United States, but they may require you to provide the address of a
non-party to the case. That person may not live in the same country as the
jurisdiction of the form.

International addresses are complicated. Divisions like "state" may have a
different name and may not be commonly used to address mail in some countries.
The order of fields like postal code and apartment number may be totally
different.

Ideally, your address fields should accommodate the order and presence of fields
for at least the most common countries that your users will provide addresses
from.

The most common field that will cause trouble is the drop-down menu for "state".
You may want to replace this with a free-text field and make it optional when an
international address might be provided in your interview.

### Consider a fall back of a completely open text field

The most flexible input of all for an address is a wide-open text field. This
may be appropriate to show as an alternative, even if your user is able to
select the country, to handle countries with address formats that you may not
know in advance.

Keep in mind that this may not be a very good user experience for most users.
Your default address question should be more standardized.

## Impounded addresses

Impounded addresses are addresses that should be hidden or redacted on certain documents for safety or privacy reasons. This feature is commonly needed in domestic violence cases, restraining orders, or other sensitive legal situations where revealing an address could put someone at risk.

The Assembly Line framework supports both impounded addresses and impounded phone numbers.

### When to use impounded addresses

Use the impounded address feature when:

- The user's address needs to be kept confidential for safety reasons
- Court rules allow or require address impounding in your jurisdiction  
- The user may need some documents to show their full address (like for service), while other documents should redact it
- You need to collect the address for court records but hide it from opposing parties

### Basic impounded address collection

Add the `ask_if_impounded=True` parameter to the `address_fields()` method to include a checkbox asking if the address should be impounded:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Assembly Line Example" label="Assembly Line Example" default>

```yaml
id: user address
sets:
  - users[0].address.address
  - users[0].address.city
question: |
  Your address
subquestion: |
  What is your current address?
fields:
  - code: |
      users[0].address_fields(ask_if_impounded=True)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Vanilla Docassemble" label="Vanilla Docassemble">

```yaml
---
id: user address  
question: |
  Your address
subquestion: |
  What is your current address?
fields:
  - Street address: users[0].address.address
    address autocomplete: True
  - Unit: users[0].address.unit
    required: False
  - City: users[0].address.city
  - State: users[0].address.state
    code: |
      states_list()
    default: MA      
  - Zip: users[0].address.zip
    required: False
  - This address is impounded: users[0].address.impounded
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      Check this box if this address should be kept confidential for safety reasons.
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Impounded phone numbers

Similarly, you can collect and impound phone numbers:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Assembly Line Example" label="Assembly Line Example" default>

```yaml
id: contact information
question: |
  Your contact information
fields:  
  - Mobile number: users[0].mobile_number
    required: False
  - Other phone number: users[0].phone_number
    required: False
  - My phone number is impounded: users[0].phone_impounded
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      Check this if your phone number should be kept confidential.
  - Email address: users[0].email    
    datatype: email
    required: False
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Vanilla Docassemble" label="Vanilla Docassemble">

```yaml
id: contact information
question: |
  Your contact information
fields:  
  - Mobile number: users[0].mobile_number
    required: False
  - Other phone number: users[0].phone_number
    required: False  
  - My phone number is impounded: users[0].phone_impounded
    datatype: yesno
    help: |
      Check this if your phone number should be kept confidential.
  - Email address: users[0].email    
    datatype: email
    required: False
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Displaying impounded information

By default, if an address or phone number is marked as impounded, it will display as **IMPOUNDED** instead of the actual information when used in templates or document assembly.

To override this and show the actual impounded information (for example, on documents meant for court filing), use the `show_impounded=True` parameter:

```yaml
# This will show "**IMPOUNDED**" if the address is impounded
${ users[0].address_block() }

# This will show the actual address even if impounded  
${ users[0].address_block(show_impounded=True) }

# Same applies to phone numbers
${ users[0].phone_numbers() }  # Shows "**IMPOUNDED**" if impounded
${ users[0].phone_numbers(show_impounded=True) }  # Shows actual number
```

### Methods that support impounded addresses

All address display methods support the `show_impounded` parameter:

- `address.block(show_impounded=True)`
- `address.line_one(show_impounded=True)` 
- `address.line_two(show_impounded=True)`
- `address.on_one_line(show_impounded=True)`
- `person.address_block(show_impounded=True)`
- `person.phone_numbers(show_impounded=True)`

### Custom impounded text labels

You can customize the text that appears when information is impounded by defining these templates in your interview:

```yaml
# Custom label for the impounded checkbox
template: ALAddress.impounded_label
content: |
  Keep this address confidential

# Custom text shown instead of impounded addresses  
template: ALAddress.impounded_output_label
content: |
  [CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS]

# Custom text shown instead of impounded phone numbers
template: ALIndividual.impounded_phone_output_label  
content: |
  [CONFIDENTIAL PHONE]
```

### Complete example

Here's a complete example showing how to collect and use impounded information:

```yaml
---
include:
  - assembly_line.yml
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  users[0].address.address
  users[0].phone_number
  final_screen
---
sets:
  - users[0].address.address
question: |
  Your address
fields:
  - code: |
      users[0].address_fields(ask_if_impounded=True)
---
question: |
  Your contact information
fields:  
  - Phone number: users[0].phone_number
    required: False
  - My phone number is impounded: users[0].phone_impounded
    datatype: yesno
---
event: final_screen
question: |
  Review your information
subquestion: |
  ## For most documents (public filing):
  
  **Address:** ${ users[0].address_block() }
  
  **Phone:** ${ users[0].phone_numbers() }
  
  ## For confidential court records:
  
  **Address:** ${ users[0].address_block(show_impounded=True) }
  
  **Phone:** ${ users[0].phone_numbers(show_impounded=True) }
```

:::warning
When using `normalized_address()`, the geocoded result will not be redacted even if the original address is impounded. Use the original address object for impounded content.
