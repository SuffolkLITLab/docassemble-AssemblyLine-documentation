Guided interviews aren't constrained by the length of a piece of paper. But
you need to apply your own restraint to make sure that questions are asked
at a pace that your user can answer easily.

Screen breaks can act as a signpost that tells the user that you have finished
one topic and are ready to move on to another.

## First, organize fields into topics

Before you work on a screen, follow the guidance about [structuring your interview](question_style_structure.md#group-similar-questions-together-by-topic)
to make sure your fields are grouped into logical topics.

## Ask the most restrictive questions on the screen first

If a response to an early question rules out the need to ask a follow-up,
ask it first. There are few things more annoying than answering a question,
scrolling down, and then seeing you need to re-write your answer to the first
question because you included an answer that was supposed to come later.

Consider adding in your own "ruling out" questions to make the rest of a screen easier to
answer or to allow removing complicated instructions. They don't need to exist on the form.

:::tip An effective ruling out question
How old is John?

  - [ ] I don't know when John was born
  - Birthdate ______________________
  - Best estimate of age (in years) _________________
:::

## Ask for only a few fields on each screen

A good rule of thumb is to ask for no more than about 5 pieces of information on
each screen. Users seldom mind answering a lot of simple questions one screen at 
a time. A long screen that requires scrolling from the heading or instructions
to each fill-in field can slow your user down more than clicking the "next"
button.

This is a suggestion, not a rule. Sometimes, it may be more
confusing to the user to split the information into multiple screens than to
see a list of 6 or 7 fields on one screen. This may be true especially
when you are asking the user for a single piece of information, like their
address, but ask them to provide it in multiple fields, like street address,
postal code, and city.

## Where possible, ask short follow-up questions on the same screen

Use a field on the same screen to ask your user for follow-up information when:

1. the field is short
1. it relates directly to the answer the user just provided

Example:

1. Are you married?
    - What is your spouse's name?

Keeping the follow-up question on the same screen gives the user context.
