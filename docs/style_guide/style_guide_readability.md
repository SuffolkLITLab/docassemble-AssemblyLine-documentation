Guided interviews usually have much less writing than other kinds of web content. But
it is important that the text that you do have is clear and easy to read. It usually
delivers important context or instructions that your user needs to follow correctly
to exercise their legal rights.

## Target a 6th grade reading level {#target-reading-level}

Overall, your goal in writing should be to make it readable by someone with a
6th grade education level. Studies consistently show that the [average American
can read and understand content written at an 8th grade
level](https://www.wyliecomm.com/2021/08/whats-the-latest-u-s-literacy-rate/),
with significant numbers of Americans reading at a lower level.

You can measure the readability of your text with automated tools:

* in Docassemble, by [clicking the "source" button](https://docassemble.org/docs/helloworld.html#tocAnchor-1-1)
* by installing the free [WriteClearly bookmarklet](https://www.openadvocate.org/writeclearly/)
* by using free tools such as [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/)

However, learning to write clearly is not just about getting a good "grade" on your writing
from one of the tools listed above. Try reading the rules below. Start out with these
rules in mind before you write.

## Use simple words {#simple-words}
See [the United States government's table showing how to simplify words](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/use-simple-words-phrases/)

Below is a shortened version of the list. Whenever it is possible, replace the words in the left column with the words in the right column.

| Replace this | Use this |
|:-|:-|
| obtain | get |
| receive | get |
| whether | if |
| such as | like |
| provide | give |
| assist | help |

It's a good idea to draw most words from the list of [the most common 2000 words](https://www.talkenglish.com/vocabulary/top-2000-vocabulary.aspx) in the English language. A [vocabulary profiler](http://www4.caes.hku.hk/vocabulary/profile.htm) can help you check
to see if you are using uncommon words.

For a fun option, the [UpGoer5](https://splasho.com/upgoer5/latest.php) text editor
allows you to type using only the most common 1,000 words.

### Avoid contractions (can't, don't) {#avoid-contractions}
Write out the words instead, like "cannot" or "do not".

### Avoid idioms ('get the hang of it', 'sit tight') {#avoid-idioms}
Other examples: Up in the air, on the ball, rule of thumb.

## Use short sentences without multiple clauses {#short-sentences}

Shorter sentences are usually easier to read. Sentences that say only
one thing are also usually easier to read. A short sentence has fewer than 20 words.

## Write in active voice, not passive voice {#active-voice}

[Active voice](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/active-vs-passive-voice-difference) sentences make it clear who is doing what. Readers, especially those
who read English as a second language, have an easier time reading sentences in the
active voice. Active voice sentences are also less ambiguous than passive voice sentences.
Sometimes passive voice sentences leave the subject out altogether.

:::tip Active voice
The dog knocked over the lamp.
:::

:::warning Passive voice
The lamp was knocked over by the dog.
:::

:::danger Passive voice (even worse!)
The lamp was knocked over.
:::

[This article about the topic from the University of Arizona writing center](https://writingcenter.uagc.edu/active-vs-passive-voice) has a helpful breakdown.

### Tips to locate and avoid passive voice
#### Do the key words make sense on their own?

If you can say the subject, action, and object in the order they appear in the sentence and it makes sense, you have written in active voice. For instance, you can say "Sally drove car" [re: Sally drove the car off the cliff] and can understand the meaning. However, if you say "Car driven Sally" [re: The car was driven off the cliff by Sally] it does not make sense; this scenario would indicate that you wrote the sentence in passive voice.

#### Look for "by" phrases

For example, "by Sally" or "by the dog" might be a sign that the sentence is passive voice.

#### Look for a form of "to be"

Look for words like is, was, were, are, or been. These words might signal passive voice.

## Use straightforward grammar

### Ask one question per sentence

A compound question asks the user to answer more than one thing in the same question. 

Examples:

:::tip Two easy to read questions
Do you have a case in the Probate and Family court?

- [ ] I have a case in the Probate and Family Court now.

- [ ] I am planning to file a case in the Probate and Family Court.
:::

:::danger One hard to read question
Do you currently have a case in the Probate and Family Court or are you planning to file one?
:::

### Write out "or" rather than using `/` to separate related concepts or and/or
Avoid "and/or" all together. Avoid  this Janus-faced term. It can often be
replaced by "and" or "or" with no loss in meaning.

If you think the "and/or" concept is important in a sentence, use this format
instead: "Option one **or** option 2 **or** both." For example, use "Take a
sleeping pill **or** a warm drink, **or** both." Do think about other
possibilities. For example, "Take a sleeping pill, maybe with a warm drink."

Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/part2/ch05/psec250.html)


## Write positive sentences that say what to do. Avoid saying what not to do.

Rules are easier to understand if they are written as positive statements.
State the action that you want the user to take so they don't need to work
it out on their own by reasoning backwards.

For example:

:::tip Positive rule
Use lots of details in your description.
:::

:::warning Negative rule
Be careful not to leave information out of your description.
:::

## Put conditions (or choices) before actions

Instructions that are written in the form of "If condition then do action" are
easier to follow than the reverse order. See [Dixon, Peter (1987)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0749-596X(87)90060-X). (We learned about this study from [Jarrett and Gaffney (2009)](https://www.amazon.com/Forms-that-Work-Interactive-Technologies/dp/1558607102).)

Why? The user can stop reading the sentence as soon as they see that the 
condition does not apply to them.

Example: 

:::tip Condition then action
If you need the judge to order something else, you can file a motion later.
:::

:::danger Action then condition
File a motion if you want the judge to order something else.
