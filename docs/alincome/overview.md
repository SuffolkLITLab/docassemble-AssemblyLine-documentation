## Overview

Gathering detailed financial information about a person can be complicated. They could have
multiple jobs, each with a different pay period, and you might need to report their pay
from all of those jobs monthly or annually. You might also need to ask about expenses,
debts, and then allow users to review and add or change that information.

The ALIncome module and associated YAML files were made to handle all of these complicated
cases, so you can focus on the details specific to your clients.
