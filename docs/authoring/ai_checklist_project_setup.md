Use this checklist before asking an AI to generate or edit interview code.

- [ ] Create package scaffold with `dacreate` and initialize Git.
- [ ] Put source templates in `docassemble/<PackageName>/data/templates/`.
- [ ] Gather authoritative legal references for this specific form and jurisdiction.
- [ ] Tell the AI the exact jurisdiction, court level, and filing context.
- [ ] Tell the AI which documents are canonical and which are optional.
- [ ] Confirm your package folders and filenames are consistent.
- [ ] Decide whether to use local tools, REST, or MCP endpoints.
