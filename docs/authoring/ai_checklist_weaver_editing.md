Use this checklist after labels are ready and you are generating a draft interview.

- [ ] Run Weaver generation (UI, REST, or MCP workflow) to produce first-pass YAML.
- [ ] Confirm generated files are copied into the right package folders.
- [ ] Review and simplify interview flow; merge or split screens as needed.
- [ ] Replace weak/placeholder prompts with plain-language text.
- [ ] Ensure object patterns are used correctly (`name_fields`, `address_fields`, etc.).
- [ ] Remove unnecessary default-role or list-gathering screens.
- [ ] Confirm conditions, required fields, and screen order match legal workflow.
