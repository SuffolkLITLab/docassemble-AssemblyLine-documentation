Use this checklist before publishing or handing off for legal/content review.

- [ ] Run through the interview end-to-end with realistic sample facts.
- [ ] Confirm review screens show human-readable values (not raw invariants).
- [ ] Verify all attachment mappings produce expected PDF/DOCX output.
- [ ] Check translations and translation-safe `choices` patterns.
- [ ] Confirm reading level and plain-language standards.
- [ ] Ensure metadata and publishing fields are complete and correct.
- [ ] Capture open legal questions or assumptions for attorney review.
