A landing page is a dedicated web page that introduces your guided interview and provides essential context before users begin. Landing pages are crucial for user success and should always be shared instead of direct interview links.

## Why landing pages matter

**For users:**
- Provides context about what the interview will do and what they'll need
- Sets proper expectations about time requirements and outcomes
- Offers an opportunity to determine if the tool is right for their situation
- Reduces abandonment rates and user frustration

**For organizations:**
- Improves search engine optimization (SEO) and discoverability
- Provides better analytics and tracking capabilities  
- Allows for easier updates and maintenance
- Creates opportunities for additional resources and support information

## Essential elements of a landing page

### Clear, descriptive title
Use language that matches how people search for help with their legal problem, not just the official form name.

**Instead of:** "Massachusetts Complaint for Protection from Abuse (209A)"  
**Try:** "Get a restraining order in Massachusetts"

### Brief, scannable description
Most users won't read lengthy explanations. Focus on the most important information:

- What legal problem this solves
- Who it's for (and who it's not for)
- What the end result will be
- Estimated time to complete

### Prerequisites and requirements
Help users determine if they're ready to start by listing:

- Information they'll need to gather
- Documents they should have available  
- Eligibility requirements
- Any court filing fees or other costs

### What happens after completion
Users need to know their next steps:

- How they'll receive their completed forms
- Where and how to file documents
- What to expect in court
- Additional resources for follow-up help

## Best practices for landing page content

### Focus on just-in-time information
Since users often skip detailed reading, prioritize information they absolutely need before starting. Save detailed explanations for help text within the interview itself.

### Use plain language
- Write at an 8th-grade reading level or lower
- Avoid legal jargon and technical terms
- Define necessary legal terms clearly
- Use active voice and short sentences

### Make it scannable
- Use bullet points and short paragraphs
- Include clear headings and subheadings
- Highlight key information visually
- Consider using icons or graphics to break up text

### Address common concerns
Anticipate and address frequent user questions:

- "Is this the right form for my situation?"
- "How long will this take?"
- "What if I make a mistake?"
- "Is my information secure?"

## SEO optimization for landing pages

A well-optimized landing page helps people find your interview through search engines. This complements the broader [SEO strategies](../get_started/search_engine_optimization.md) for legal help websites.

### Target user search terms
Research how people actually search for help with this legal issue:

- Use tools like Google's "People also ask" suggestions
- Check related search terms at the bottom of Google results  
- Consider variations in terminology (legal vs. common language)
- Think about urgent vs. planning-ahead searches

### Optimize key elements
- **Page title:** Include primary keywords users search for
- **Meta description:** Summarize the page in 150-160 characters
- **Headings:** Use H1, H2, H3 tags with relevant keywords
- **URL:** Keep it short and descriptive

### Create quality content
Search engines prioritize helpful, comprehensive content:

- Answer the questions users are actually asking
- Provide value beyond just linking to the interview
- Include relevant local information when applicable
- Link to related resources and official sources

## Integration with project workflow

### During development
Include landing page creation in your interview development process:

1. Draft landing page content alongside interview planning
2. Test the landing page with potential users
3. Refine based on user feedback and common questions
4. Ensure consistency between landing page and interview flow

### After launch
- Monitor user behavior and feedback
- Update content based on frequently asked questions
- Keep information current as laws or procedures change
- Track performance through analytics

### Promotion and sharing
Always share the landing page URL, not the direct interview link:

- When working with partner organizations
- In presentations and educational materials  
- On social media and in newsletters
- When speaking with journalists or other media

## Examples of effective elements

### Clear call-to-action
**Good:** "Start your restraining order application now"  
**Better:** "Get help filing for a restraining order - Start here"

### Realistic time estimates
**Vague:** "This will take a few minutes"  
**Specific:** "Most people complete this in 15-20 minutes"

### Helpful warnings
**Generic:** "Make sure you have all required information"  
**Specific:** "You'll need the other person's full name and address. If you don't have their address, that's okay - you can still file."

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Too much information:** Overwhelming users with every possible detail
- **Legal language:** Using terminology that users don't understand
- **Missing context:** Not explaining what the interview actually does
- **No next steps:** Leaving users unsure what happens after completion
- **Outdated information:** Not maintaining currency with law changes
- **Direct interview links:** Bypassing the landing page entirely

## Measuring success

Track these metrics to evaluate your landing page effectiveness:

- **Conversion rate:** Percentage of landing page visitors who start the interview
- **Completion rate:** Percentage who finish after starting
- **Time on page:** How long users spend reading before deciding
- **Bounce rate:** Percentage who leave without taking action
- **User feedback:** Comments and questions about clarity and usefulness
