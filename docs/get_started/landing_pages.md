A landing page is a dedicated web page that introduces your guided interview and provides essential context before users begin.
It is not part of the interview itself. Landing pages are helpful for user success and should always be shared instead of direct
interview links.

[CourtFormsOnline.org](https://courtformsonline.org) is where landing pages for interviews built by the Suffolk LIT Lab
live.

You can build a landing page in a dedicated web application like CourtFormsOnline (we use Next.js), or in a legal help
site built on a technology like [Drupal](https://drupal.org) or [WordPress](https://wordpress.org).

The [metadata](../authoring/weaver_code_anatomy.md#interview-metadata-and-metadata-for-publishing-on-courtformsonline)
block in an interview created by the [AssemblyLine Weaver](../authoring/weaver_overview.md) will help you automatically
create a landing page with relevant content for publishing on CourtFormsOnline.

## Why landing pages matter

1. Helps users know if they are in the right place before they start using your application.
1. Helps make it easier for people to discover your content using the principles of [SEO](search_engine_optimization.md).

## Essential elements of a landing page

### Clear, descriptive title

Use language that matches how people search for help with their legal problem, not just the official form name.

**Instead of:** "Massachusetts Complaint for Protection from Abuse (209A)"  
**Try:** "Get a restraining order in Massachusetts"

### Brief, scannable description

Most users won't read lengthy explanations. Focus on the most important information:

* What legal problem this solves
* Who it's for (and who it's not for)
* What the end result will be
* Estimated time to complete

### Prerequisites and requirements

Help users determine if they're ready to start by listing:

* Information they'll need to gather
* Documents they should have available  
* Eligibility requirements
* Any court filing fees or other costs

### What happens after completion

Users need to know their next steps:

* How they'll receive their completed forms
* Where and how to file documents
* What to expect in court
* Additional resources for follow-up help

## Best practices for landing page content

### Focus on just-in-time information

Since users often skip detailed reading, prioritize information they absolutely need before starting. Save detailed explanations for help text within the interview itself.

### Use plain language

Follow our detailed recommendations for [plain language](../style_guide/style_guide_readability.md).

### Make it scannable

* Use bullet points and short paragraphs
* Include clear headings and subheadings
* Highlight key information visually

### Address common concerns

Anticipate and address frequent user questions:

* "Is this the right form for my situation?"
* "How long will this take?"
* "What if I make a mistake?"
* "Is my information secure?"

## Promotion and sharing

Always share the landing page URL, not the direct interview link:

* When working with partner organizations
* In presentations and educational materials  
* On social media and in newsletters
* When speaking with journalists or other media
