:::warning
We are actively updating the Document Assembly Line workflow and much of the information in this section is outdated.
:::

The guidance below is for organizations that want to set up their **own** copy of the 
Assembly Line, not for individual automators.

We think that the most important work we did came not from computer code, but a
process: the process of automating a legal form, broken down into a series of
small steps.

## Our Trello boards {#trello}
We turned that process into a series of
[Kanban](https://blog.trello.com/kanban-data-nave) boards, and if you want you
can jump straight to
[copying](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards) and
customizing them for your needs:

1. [AssemblyLine - Pre-processing Template Board](https://trello.com/b/Z2Svx3oh/1-assemblyline-pre-processing-template-board#)
1. [AssemblyLine - Development Template Board](https://trello.com/b/ArfGFbz4/2-assemblyline-development-template-board)
1. [AssemblyLine - Testing Template Board](https://trello.com/b/nT7yy2Wl/3-assemblyline-testing-template-board)

## Overview

Automating a form involves:

* Research and vetting the substantive content
* Coding
* Adding labeled fields to a template document
* Generating and refining a prototype
* Testing and getting feedback
