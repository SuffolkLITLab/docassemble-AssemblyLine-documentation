Whether you are a LIT Clinic student, a recent [Forms Camp](https://www.ncsc.org/consulting-and-research/areas-of-expertise/access-to-justice/forms-camp) graduate, or anyone else getting started on an interview project—whether it is your first or fiftieth—this page will guide you through the stages of an interview-building project, from concept to launch.

This roadmap reflects the procedures, templates, and tools the LIT Lab uses on our interview-building projects, which you can adapt to yours.

## Identify Key Roles & Responsibilities

![Interview Project Roles & Lines of Communication](../assets/interview-project-roles-communication.png)

Every interview project has:

1. **Interview builders.** The person or team responsible for building the actual interview.
2. **Decisionmaker.** One person who is responsible for managing stakeholders and converting their feedback into clear decisions for the interview builders.
3. **Stakeholders.** Anyone who needs to have a say in the interview project, such as managers, judges, clerks, subject matter experts, IT staff, and users (self-represented litigants and lawyers).

:::note
You may have a team of interview builders and dozens of stakeholders, or you may be the only person working on this project. Even if this is a solo project, it helps to keep your different roles in mind.
:::

### The Decisionmaker

**While a successful interview project needs all these roles, the decisionmaker is especially important.** Most interview projects involve multiple stakeholders. When the interview building team requests guidance or feedback, multiple stakeholders may give multiple responses that may be confusing or conflicting. This dramatically slows progress.

The decisionmaker's job is to gather and clarify stakeholders' feedback so that interview builders have clear decisions to work from. The decisionmaker's responsibilities also include:

* Being a single point of contact and single source of decisions
* Regular meetings with the interview building team
* Timely responses to requests for feedback
* Gathering feedback or approvals from stakeholders and converting it to clear decisions
* Making the go/no-go decision to launch the interview

The decisionmaker must either (1) have the authority necessary to carry out these responsiblities, or (2) be responsible for getting authority when necessary.

## Kickoff Meeting

Schedule a kickoff meeting for the project as early as possible. The interview building team, the decisionmaker, and the key stakeholders should attend.

Kickoff meeting agenda:

* Everyone should introduce themselves and identify their role in the project
* Discuss the reason for having a single decisionmaker and identify that person
* Give an overview of the development process (use this page)
* Schedule a regular check-in meeting (weekly or every other week)
* Introduce the form and how it will be used
  * Who will use it and what are they called? Who else appears on the form? Who can't use it?
  * What can someone do with it? What can't they do with it?
  * When would someone use it, and what will have happened before they do?
  * Where would someone use it? Where would they file it?
  * Why would someone use it?
  * How do they file it? If it shouldn't be filed, how do they use it after completing it?
* Agree on a [minimum viable product (MVP)](assembly_line_setup#stick-to-an-mvp) and define the requirements for this project
* Agree on a process for changing the scope of the project (i.e., adding features)
* Discuss what success looks like for this project, and how you will measure it
* Do a [pre-mortem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem)—imagine this project has failed and discuss why

:::info
If this is a solo project you should still make time for a kickoff "meeting" with yourself.

## Build the Interview

After the kickoff meeting it is time to get to work! Interview building includes:

* Coding (following the [GitHub workflow](../github.md#workflow))
* Keeping track of tasks, change requests, questions, etc., using [GitHub issues](../github.md#use-issues)
* Getting help with blockers ([resources](resources.md))
* Testing the interview
* Demonstrating the interview
* Regular standups with the interview building team
* Regular check-ins with the decisionmaker and key stakeholders
* More coding

The LIT Lab's [interview project template](https://github.com/orgs/SuffolkLITLab/projects/22) can help you keep your project organized. Just click the **Use this template** button to use it. (You'll need a free [GitHub](../github.md) account.)
:::

### Standup Meetings with the Interview-Building Team

Regular "standups" help keep your project moving forward. The interview-building team should have frequent standup meetings to share progress and identify blockers. A standup is a very short, 5–15 minute meeting with a straightforward standing agenda:

1. **Progress:** what you worked on or accomplished since the last meeting
2. **Plan:** what you are working on now
3. **Blockers:** what issues are blocking you

Daily check-ins are most common on active projects, and anything less than weekly is unlikely to be adequate.

:::tip
Consider incorporating our Monday community meetings into your standup schedule. We run them standup-style, with time for addressing blockers as a group. If this is a solo project, the community can be part of your interview-building team!
:::

### Check-Ins with the Decisionmaker & Key Stakeholders

Weekly or every-other week meetings with the decisionmaker and key stakeholders are a chance to keep them informed and get answers when you need them to move forward.

:::tip
Use [GitHub issues](../github.md#use-issues) with the **question** label to help you keep track of questions you need to ask the decisionmaker.
:::

The decisionmaker and stakeholder will probably want a demonstration of the interview. To do this:

1. Demonstrate the interview to a more experienced interview builder, first. This will help identify problems you can solve on your own, as well as questions you need to ask the decisionmaker.
2. Create a separate Docassemble Playground project for your demo and make sure it works.
3. When you demonstrate the interview, listen carefully to the feedback and ask as many questions as you need to make sure you understand it.

:::warning
**If you ask a question you will get an answer.** And since the decisionmaker and stakeholders are not building the interview they may not understand the full implication of their answers. To get better answers, ask better questions. Some tips:

* Avoid open-ended questions
* Present options and explain the implications of each option
* Propose a solution that makes sense to you (but remain open to alternatives)
* Explain the pros and cons of the options

To make sure you understand the answer, repeat the answer back to the decisionmaker. When you are sure, write it down (ideally on the related GitHub issue).

## Get Feedback on the Completed Interview

Once the interview is built, it's time to hand it over to the decisionmaker for feedback. 

## Get a Go/No-Go Decision

## Launch the Interview
