Whether you are a LIT Clinic student, a recent [Forms Camp](https://www.ncsc.org/consulting-and-research/areas-of-expertise/access-to-justice/forms-camp) graduate, or anyone else getting started on an interview project—whether it is your first or fiftieth—this page will guide you through the stages of an interview-building project, from concept to launch.

## Identify Roles

There are three essential groups of people involved in an interview building project.

1. **Interview builders.** The person or team responsible for building the actual interview, including at least one developer and a project manager.
2. **Decisionmaker.** One person who is responsible for managing stakeholders and converting their feedback into clear decisions.
3. **Stakeholders.** Anyone who needs to have a say in the interview project, such as managers, judges, clerks, subject matter experts, IT staff, and users (self-represented litigants and lawyers).

:::note
You may have a team of interview builders and dozens of stakeholders, or you may be the only person working on this project. Even if this is a solo project, it helps to keep your different roles in mind.

**While a successful interview project needs all these roles, the decisionmaker is especially important.**

Most interview projects involve multiple stakeholders. When the interview building team requests guidance or feedback, multiple stakeholders may give multiple responses that may be confusing or conflicting. This dramatically slows progress.

The decisionmaker's job is to gather and clarify stakeholders' feedback so that interview builders have clear decisions to work from. The decisionmaker's responsibilities also include:

* Being a single point of contact and single source of decisions
* Regular meetings with the interview building team
* Timely responses to requests for feedback
* Gathering feedback or approvals from stakeholders and converting it to clear decisions
* Making the go/no-go decision to launch the interview

The decisionmaker must either (1) have the authority necessary to carry out these responsiblities, or (2) be responsible for getting authority when necessary.

## Kickoff Meeting

Schedule a kickoff meeting for the project as early as possible. The interview building team, the decisionmaker, and the key stakeholders should attend.

Kickoff meeting agenda:

* Everyone should introduce themselves and identify their role in the project
* Agree on a single decisionmaker
* Describe the development process (use this page)
* Schedule a regular check-in meeting
* Walk through the procedural context for the form
  * Who will be using this form? (What are they called?) Who can't use it?
  * What does this form do? What can someone do with it? What can't they do with it?
  * When in the process would someone use this form? What has happened before they use it?
  * Where would someone file this form?
  * Why would someone use this form?
  * How does someone file this form?
* Agree on a [minimum viable product (MVP)](assembly_line_setup#stick-to-an-mvp) and define the requirements for this project
* Agree on a process for changing the scope of the project (i.e., adding features)
* Discuss what success looks like for this project, and how you will measure it
* Conduct a [pre-mortem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem) discussion (imaging this project has failed and discuss why)

If this is a solo project you should still make time for a kickoff "meeting" with yourself.

## Build the Interview

After the kickoff meeting, it's time to get to work! Interview building includes:

* Coding (following the [GitHub workflow](../github.md#workflow))
* Keeping track of tasks, change requests, questions, etc., using [GitHub issues](../github.md#use-issues)
* Testing your interview
* Getting help with blockers ([resources](resources.md))
* Regular standups with the interview building team
* Regular check-ins with the decisionmaker and key stakeholders
* Getting feedback from the decisionmaker
* More coding

:::tip
The LIT Lab's [interview project template](https://github.com/orgs/SuffolkLITLab/projects/22) can help you keep your project organized. Just click the **Use this template** button to use it. (You'll need a free [GitHub](../github.md) account.)
:::

The interview building team should have its own regularly-scheduled "standup" meetings to share progress and identify blockers. A standup is a very short, 5–15 minute meeting with a straightforward standing agenda:

1. **Progress:** what you worked on or accomplished since the last meeting
2. **Plan:** what you are working on now
3. **Blockers:** what issues are blocking you

Daily check-ins are most common on active projects, and anything less than weekly is unlikely to be adequate.

:::tip
Consider incorporating our Monday community meetings into your standup schedule. We run them standup-style, with time for addressing blockers as a group.

## Get Feedback

Once the interview is built, it's time to hand it over to the decisionmaker for feedback. 

## Get a Go/No-Go Decision

## Launch the Interview
