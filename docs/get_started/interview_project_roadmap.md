Whether you are a LIT Clinic student, a recent [Forms Camp](https://www.ncsc.org/consulting-and-research/areas-of-expertise/access-to-justice/forms-camp) graduate, or anyone else getting started on an interview project—whether it is your first or fiftieth—this page will guide you through the stages of an interview-building project.

<!-- 

Audience/who is using this page: Forms Camp grads. In other words, someone at a court or legal aid org who is going to start building an interview.

## Identify Roles



## First Meeting with Stakeholders

Meeting goals:

Overall: define expectations/get on the same page

* Introduce the development process
* Define roles and responsibilities
* Identify the single decisionmaker (most important)
* Define the requirements—including things we'll need in the future
* Discuss MVPs and select the maturity model level
* Discuss "change orders"—establish a process for changing the scope of the process
* Identify the source documents
* What does success look like? How do we measure it?
* How do we know if this project isn't going to work? Failure states
* Schedule a regular check-in with the decisionmaker to keep them, ask and answer questions, and get decisions when you need them to move forward.

How does this look different when you are your own stakeholder? (All this stuff still needs to happen!)

## Building the Interview

What the building workflow/cadence/whatever looks like 

* Coding (incl. collaboration—link to GH workflow)
* Getting support: community meetings/posting questions to DAL Teams/Slack
* Testing
* Regular stakeholder check-ins


## Get Feedback on the Draft Interview

## Get a Go/No-Go Decision

## Launch the Interview


============

## Prepare the Court Form for the Weaver

Before you can use the Weaver you must prepare each PDF or DOCX document with fields and labels for the Weaver to recognize. These pages will help:

* ["Weaving" your form into a draft interview](../generating_code)
* [Working with PDF Files](../pdfs)
* [Working with DOCX Files](../docx)
* [Field labels to use in template files](../label_variables)

If you don't have much experience with the Weaver, ask someone with more experience to review your prepared documents before you run them through.

While you prepare your document(s) for the Weaver, get set up in GitHub and start using our project template.
