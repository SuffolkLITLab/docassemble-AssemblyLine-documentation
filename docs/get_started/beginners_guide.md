If you have never used Docassemble before, you are on the right page! Below are a quick introduction, an in-depth interview builder training course, and additional resources.

:::tip
You will need access to a [Docassemble playground](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html), but if you don't have one you can use ours! Register an account on the [LIT Lab Docassemble development server](https://apps-dev.suffolklitlab.org/user/register), then [email us](mailto:litlab@suffolk.edu) and ask for developer privileges.

## Quick introduction

[The Hello, World exercise](#do-the-hello-world-exercise) is a quick, friendly introduction to Docassemble.

After doing the exercise, [watch a demonstration of the Weaver](https://www.youtube.com/live/1zF_omoCm1c?si=u9MqDGm_1G3iAH7t&t=1595), a Document Assembly Line tool for quickly turning prepared forms into draft Docassemble interviews. The code generated by the Weaver is not a finished interview; it is a starting point intended for further editing.

Finally, [review the interview project management page](#review-the-interview-project-management-guide) to get an idea of what an interview-building project is like.

## Interview builder training

To go beyond the introduction, follow along with our [3-part interview builder training on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwjDOPxdoJU&list=PLy6i9GFGw5Gy3oFiIhBpj5gn5PP_Vbd-5).

You can find additional [training materials on GitHub](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-DALTraining), and you should join the Document Assembly Line community for help when you get stuck. We meet weekly for live support, host [monthly workshops](https://suffolklitlab.org/tag/first-wednesday-workshops/), and coding help is available 24/7 in our Microsoft Teams forum.

To join the Document Assembly Line community, just [email us](mailto:litlab@suffolk.edu) your request.
