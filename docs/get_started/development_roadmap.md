The Document Assembly Line is under continuous development, based on input from the courts and legal aid organizations that use it and participate in the [community](intro.md#join-the-community). This roadmap contains the master plan and current development priorities, which are made possible by our [partners](/#partners).

## Master plan

Our ambitious, long-term goals for the Document Assembly Line are:

* Establish a national document assembly and e-filing infrastructure for courts and legal-aid organizations
* Foster a community of courts and legal aid organizations building access-to-justice tools using the Document Assembly Line

## Current priorities

### Grant-funded deliverables

In partnership with Legal Services Vermont, funded by a Technology Initiative Grant from the Legal Services Corporation, the LIT Lab is working on the following:

* **Complete:** Manage Docassemble hosting for at least three jurisdictions, including Vermont, by January 2025
* Create a flexible, general-purpose e-filing tool that allows e-filing documents prepared outside of Docassemble interviews, by September 2025
* Expand e-filing beyond Massachusetts and Illinois to new jurisdictions, including Vermont, by September 2025
* Support our existing e-filing code and staying current with third-party changes. Planned updates include:
  * ECF 5 compliance
  * Make it possible to separate e-filing configuration code from Docassemble interview code

### Additional priorities
