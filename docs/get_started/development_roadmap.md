The Document Assembly Line is under continuous development. Our goal with this roadmap is to share our plans and priorities for the Document Assembly Line with the community.

## Current priorities

### Grant-funded deliverables

In partnership with Legal Services Vermont, funded by a Technology Initiative Grant from the Legal Services Corporation, the LIT Lab is working on the following:

* Managing Docassemble hosting for at least three jurisdictions, including Vermont, by January 2025
* Creating a flexible, general-purpose e-filing tool that allows e-filing documents prepared outside of Docassemble interviews, by September 2025
* Expanding e-filing beyond Massachusetts and Illinois to new jurisdictions, including Vermont, by September 2025
* Supporting our existing e-filing code and staying current with third-party changes. Planned updates include:
  * ECF 5 compliance
  * Making it possible to separate e-filing configuration code from Docassemble interview code

:::note
Like all our work on the Document Assembly Line, our work toward grant-funded deliverables is also subsidized by—and would not be possible without—our other funding partners, including the State Justice Institute and the Massachusetts Trial Court.

### Additional priorities

* Creating an ongoing process for shaping this development roadmap with input from the community, funding partners, etc.
* Updating this documentation website to better serve Document Assembly Line users and the project's needs
* Ongoing outreach to courts and legal aid organizations

## Long-term goals

Our ambitious, long-term goals for the Document Assembly Line are:

* Establish a national document assembly and e-filing infrastructure for courts and legal-aid organizations
* Foster a community of courts and legal aid organizations building access-to-justice tools using the Document Assembly Line
