title: Launching an interview

To launch an interview:

1. Deploy the interview to your production server
2. Create a landing page for the interview
3. Promote the interview

:::tip
You may want to "soft launch" new interviews by deploying the interview to your production server but waiting to create a landing page and promote the interview. This gives you a chance to collect initial feedback from actual users make sure the interview works as expected while limiting the impact of any problems or negative feedback.

## Deploy the interview to your production server

When your interview is ready for publication, publish it by [installing the package on your production server](https://docassemble.org/docs/packages.html#installing).

Once the package is installed anyone with the [interview URL](https://docassemble.org/docs/interviews.html#invocation) will be able to use it. But [Docassemble discourages search engines](https://docassemble.org/docs/config.html#robots) from indexing interviews so it is extremely unlikely that anyone will just happen to find it.

To ensure people can find the interview you'll need to create a landing page.

## Creating an interview landing page

An interview landing page is a web page with information about an interview. A good landing page should help someone figure out if they can use the interview, gather information they might need to complete it, link to additional relevant information and resources, and start the interview. An interview landing page also gives search engines a URL to index so people who need the interview can find it using a search engine like Google.

Here are some interview landing pages from the Document Assembly Line community:

* [Ask the Massachusetts Appeals Court to stop an eviction](https://courtformsonline.org/ma/forms/appeal-or-stay-your-eviction)
* [Initiate a divorce, separation, or civil union dissolution in Vermont](https://vtlawhelp.org/vtcourtforms/divorce)
* [E-file an appearance in Illinois](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/appearance-e-filing)

This is the template we use for interview landing pages on [Court Forms Online](https://courtformsonline.org/):

:::note[Court Forms Online Landing Page Template]
_Note: Court Forms Online uses the [AssemblyLine metadata block](../authoring/weaver_code_anatomy.md#assemblyline-metadata) to generate interview landing pages. This way interview landing pages are updated when the interview package is updated._
