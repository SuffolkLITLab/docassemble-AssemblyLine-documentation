## Templates: PDF v. DOCX

In many cases, you will start with a court form or other document template that is a PDF (Adobe Acrobat) or DOCX (Microsoft Word) file. In other cases, you will be creating the template from scratch.

If your template is a PDF to begin with, consider whether to switch to DOCX.

Reasons to use PDF files:

* PDF files may be the best choice if you are automating an approved court form that already exists as a PDF
* PDF files are good for heavily formatted content that includes columns and multiple fields on a single line

Reasons to avoid PDF files:

* PDF documents are rigid, and may not contain enough room for real-world information
* Conditional logic must be applied field-by-field
* Lists and repeated data must be labeled one field at a time

Reasons to use DOCX files:

* DOCX documents will grow or shrink to accomodate as much or as little information as the user provides
* DOCX documents allow you to use lists and repeated groups naturally and with little extra effort after labeling the first item
* DOCX documents allow you to easily make whole sections of a document contingent
* DOCX documents work well with linear content that is read by scanning down the page, not across

Reasons to avoid DOCX files:

* DOCX documents do not work as well for content formatted in columns or that require precise layout
* DOCX document content may flow unexpectedly if it is longer than expected
