## Planning and automating your first interview with the Assembly Line Framework

To automate a form using the Assembly Line framework, you must:

1. research and understand the context of your form
1. identify the template that you will use: either a PDF or DOCX template
1. add digital **field labels** where the information the user provides will go
1. run the labeled template through the Assembly Line Weaver
1. download the "weaved" form and refine in your Docassemble playground
1. test, respond to feedback, and iterate
1. deploy to a production server and add links on your public website

For more information about the process of researching and planning your completed
interview, refer to [Planning and building your first expert system](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/interview-structure/building-an-app-outline).

## Selecting your template file

In many cases, you will be provided a template that you need to automate.
Ultimately, your form should be either a PDF document or a Word DOCX file.

If your document is a PDF already, consider whether to switch to a DOCX template
file.

Reasons to use PDF files:

* PDF files may be the best choice if you are automating an approved court form
  that already exists as a PDF
* PDF files are good for heavily formatted content that includes columns and multiple
  fields on a single line

Reasons to avoid PDF files:

* PDF files are rigid, and may not contain enough room for real-world
  information
* conditional logic must be appplied field by field
* lists and repeated data must be labeled one at a time for each field

Reasons to use DOCX files:

* DOCX files will grow or shrink to accomodate as much or as little information
  as the user has to provide
* DOCX files allow you to use lists and repeated groups naturally and with
  little extra effort after labeling the first item
* DOCX files allow you to easily make whole sections of a document contingent
* DOCX files work well with linear content that is read by scanning down the
  page, not across.

Reasons to avoid DOCX files:

* DOCX files work less well for content formatted into columns or that require
  precise layout
* DOCX files can be formatted, but content may flow unexpectedly if it is longer
  than expected

## Plan your interview flow and structure before you build

:::tip
Taking time to plan your interview flow before building can save you hours of rework later. A clear plan helps you identify complex branching logic early and ensures a smooth user experience.
:::

The automation process will go much better if you have planned out the basic structure for your interview, as well as thought through the information that you need to gather. Focus on creating a rough sketch of the process that your form enables as well as the questions that you will ask to fill it in.

### Why plan first?

Planning your interview flow before diving into coding helps you:

* **Identify complex logic early**: Spot conditional sections, branching paths, and dependencies before they become problems
* **Validate the legal research**: If the interview helps complete a legal form, mapping the law's requirements on paper and validating with an expert can prevent early missteps and save time
* **Create a logical question order**: Ensure users aren't asked to provide information they don't have yet
* **Avoid major rework**: Changes to flow are much easier to make in planning than after coding
* **Ensure completeness**: Make sure you gather all required information without redundancy
* **Design for user experience**: Think through the user's journey and mental model

### Tools for planning your interview flow

1. Create a flowchart that explains key decision points in the interview. Simple computer programs can help:

* [Diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net) is an online graphical flowchart tool.
* [Flowchart.fun](https://flowchart.fun) lets you build flowcharts with text and simple indentation.
* [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.live/) can build charts that can be embedded in GitHub markdown, but has a more complex syntax.

Paper and pencil works for early sketches, too.

2. If your interview involves complex legal decisions that do not easily fit in a flowchart, consider using spreadsheets (or
  [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table)) to systematically lay out the combination of variables that leads
  to various claims being valid or invalid.

Here is an example of a truth table for a defamation claim, with the familiar elements of defamation turned into Python
variables.

| false_statement | publication | harm | malice | is_public_figure | defamation_claim |
|-----------------|-------------|------|--------|------------------|------------------|
| False           | False       | False| False  | False            | False            |
| True            | False       | True | False  | False            | False            |
| True            | True        | True | False  | False            | True             |
| True            | True        | True | True   | False            | True             |
| True            | True        | True | False  | True             | False            |
| True            | True        | True | True   | True             | True             |

A more complex alternative to a truth table (that handles different kinds of values) is a [DMN](https://camunda.com/dmn/).

Here is a DMN (decision model notation)-like map of the same logical rule above:

### Decision Table: Defamation Claim

| Rule | false_statement | publication | harm | malice | is_public_figure | defamation_claim |
|------|-----------------|-------------|------|--------|------------------|------------------|
| private figures   | true            | true        | true | -      | false            | True             |
| public figures   | true            | true        | true | true   | true             | True             |
| All other cases   | -               | -           | -    | -      | -                | False            |

Flowcharts and tables can not only help you understand the logic involved in your interview, but help you communicate it
and validate it with an expert.

### What to include in your interview plan

Your planning should cover these key elements:

#### 1. User journey and entry points

* How do users find your interview?
* What brings them to this point?
* What's their mental state and level of legal knowledge?
* What steps in their legal process must already be complete before they can use your interview?

#### 2. Information gathering sequence

* What information do you need to collect?
* What order makes sense to the user?
* Which questions depend on previous answers?

#### 3. Conditional logic and branching

* When should users skip certain sections?
* What different paths might users take?
* How do different user types experience the interview?

#### 4. Review and completion

* How will users review their answers?
* What documents will be generated?
* What happens after completion?

### Sample planning workflow

1. **Start with the end**: What documents need to be produced? What information is required?

2. **Map the user journey**: Walk through the user's perspective from start to finish

3. **Create a rough flowchart**: Use any of the tools mentioned above to sketch the basic flow

4. **Identify decision points**: Mark where the interview branches based on user input

5. **Group related questions**: Organize questions into logical sections or pages

6. **Plan the review screen**: Decide how users will review and edit their answers

7. **Test with stakeholders**: Share your plan with colleagues or potential users for feedback

### Example: Planning a simple motion interview

Here's how you might plan a basic court motion interview:

```text
Start → Court information → User type (attorney/self-rep) 
   ↓
Party information → Case details → Motion type
   ↓
Motion-specific questions → Supporting facts → Relief requested
   ↓
Review screen → Document generation → Next steps/filing information
```

Even this simple flow reveals important questions:

* Should court information come first, or party information?
* How does the user type affect what questions we ask?
* What motion-specific questions are needed for each type?

### Integration with project management

Your interview planning should connect with your broader [project management approach](project_management.md). Share your flowcharts and planning documents with your team, and use them to:

* Communicate with subject matter experts and confirm your understanding of the law or process you are implementing
* Estimate development time more accurately
* Identify potential technical challenges early
* Create test cases for different user paths
* Brief developers on the intended user experience

### Continue with the automation process

Once you have finished these early planning steps, it will be time to start building.

Start by learning about the automation process for your template, whether it is:

* A [PDF](../authoring/pdf_templates.md), or
* A [DOCX](../authoring/docx_templates.md) file.

And then continuing through [labeling](../authoring/doc_vars_reference.md) and running your template through the Weaver(../authoring/weaver_overview.md).
