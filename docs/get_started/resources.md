As you are building interviews, use these resources to find answers to your questions, solve problems you run into, and get help.

:::tip
If you have been stuck on something for longer than 20 minutes, it's probably time to ask for help. Post a question in the **Coding Help** channel in Teams or bring it to our Monday meeting.

When you ask for help:

* Give details
* Share the code you are stuck on
* Share any error messages you may be getting

## Community Resources

Docassemble and the Document Assembly Line tools are open-source, which means they are built, maintained, used, and supported by a community of contributors. The Document Assembly Line is a community of courts and legal aid organizations who are building Docassemble interviews.

### Document Assembly Line

* Weekly interview builder meetings
* Community forum
* Monthly workshops

[Email us](mailto:litlab@suffolk.edu) to join!

### Docassemble

* [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/docassemble/shared_invite/zt-2cspzjo9j-YyE7SrLmi5muAvnPv~Bz~A)
* [Email list](https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/docassemble.python.org/)

## Documentation

While building interviews you will most likely have one or more documentation websites ("docs") open at all times. And when you ask for help in one of the community resources, above, you will often receive a link to documentation as part of a response. This is generally meant to be helpful, not as a way to say "[RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)."

These are the essential documentation websites to have on hand:

* [This website](/)
* [Docassemble docs](https://docassemble.org/docs.html)

Docassemble interview files use several kinds of markup. Most of what you will need to know is included on the [Docassemble markup page](https://docassemble.org/docs/markup.html), but sometimes you may need to go to the source for more detailed documentation.

* [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) (the base file format)
* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (formatting text)
* [Mako](https://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/) (using variables and code within questions)
* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html) (coding in Mako tags and [code blocks](https://docassemble.org/docs/code.html))
* [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) (used in [DOCX templates](../authoring/docx_templates.md))

You can also use [HTML](https://docassemble.org/docs/markup.html#markdownhtml), [CSS](https://docassemble.org/docs/ui.html#css), and [Javascript](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#javascript) in Docassemble interviews.

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) (advanced formatting)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) (customizing the UI)
* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) (advanced customization)

:::info JavaScript Workshop Resource
