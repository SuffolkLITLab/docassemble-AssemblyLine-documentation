The Document Assembly Line is a toolbox for building online guided interviews for court forms and other legal documents for use by self-represented litigants. It is supported by the [Legal Innovation and Technology Lab (LIT Lab)](https://suffolklitlab.org/) at [Suffolk University Law School](https://www.suffolk.edu/law/) and an active community of courts, orgs, and volunteers.

## Background

This short, 3-minute video by David Colarusso and Quinten Steenhuis explains how the Document Assembly Line was born from a large-scale international pandemic collaboration:

</p>

The LIT Lab gathered more than 200 volunteers from around the world and built tools such as:

* A [project management guide](project_management.md) for building [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org) interviews to assemble court forms for filing.
* The core [Document Assembly Line Tools](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-AssemblyLine), to make it easier to use key Docassemble features.
* The [the Weaver](../authoring/weaver_overview.md), a tool for converting existing PDF and DOCX court forms into draft Docassemble interviews in as little as one hour.
* A [library](../style_guide/question_library/names.md) of pre-built, commonly used, accessible questions, vetted by experts and translated into at least 5 languages.
* A [style guide](../style_guide/question_style_overview.md) for interview questions that are easy to read and answer.
* The first [open-source, non-profit e-filing service provider (EFSP)](components/EFSPIntegration/efsp_overview.md) so that forms completed through guided interviews could be filed directly with courts using the Tyler e-filing management system.
* A [collection of existing PDF forms](https://suffolklitlab.org/form-explorer/)
  across multiple jurisdictions.

:::

All Document Assembly Line interviews:

* Have a common look and feel, with reusable components.
* Are mobile friendly so users can do everything on a smartphone.
* Contain contextual help to guide users through the interview.
* Use a standardized structure and questions to build consistency and gain trust.
* Use address autocompletion to improve accuracy and save time.
* Allow users to text, email, or share a link to their work in progress with a
  friend or advocate if they want help.
* Have an integrated feedback form for users to report problems or send praise.
* Gather anonymized statistics in aggregate for reporting on usage.
* Support digital signatures.

## See it in action

These websites and interviews are built with the Document Assembly Line tools:

* [CourtFormsOnline](https://courtformsonline.org/) (the original)
* [Missouri Tenant Help](http://motenanthelp.org)
* Illinois Legal Aid Online's [motion](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/motion) and [transfer on death instrument (TODI)](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/transfer-death-instrument-or-todi) are some of the interviews ILAO has converted to Docassemble

## Get involved/how you can help

The Document Assembly Line is community built and supported. Because all our tools and software are open source, courts and orgs can build with confidence knowing the underlying software will be free to use, forever, with no vendor lock-in. Instead we are building digital public infrastructure together.

### Join the community

The Document Assembly Line community is hosted and supported by the [LIT Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/). The community is open to courts, legal aid organizations, and anyone else interested in building online guided interviews with Docassemble and the Document Assembly Line Tools.

You don't have to go it alone! We offer:

* **Weekly community check-ins.** Interview builders meet every Monday at 10am Eastern. We follow a standup-style agenda focused on identifying and removing "blockers." Backend developers who work on the Document Assembly Line tools have a similar meeting on Fridays at 12:30pm Eastern.
* **Community forum.** The LIT Lab hosts a community forum for the Document Assembly Line in Microsoft Teams for general discussions, coding help, server admin, and more.
* **First-Wednesday workshops.** On the first Wednesday of each month at 3pm Eastern we host online workshops where we go in-depth on topics requested by the community. These are informal sessions centered around questions from viewers. Our workshops are also streamed and archived on YouTube.

### Partner with the LIT Lab

:::tip

:::

The LIT Lab's work has been and will continue to be supported by grants. Moving forward we will also rely on [partnerships](/#partners) to help support our work. Funding from partners pays for software development and support, training, user research, community building, project management, and technical support as well as direct costs like servers and staff time.

* We offer Docassemble hosting and e-filing for courts that want to build their own interviews or enable e-filing for third-party interviews
* We offer Docassemble hosting for legal aid organizations, with a free option if the court is a funding partner
* We work with granting organizations that want to support the Document Assembly Line

### Support our work
