This pages walks you through the interview-building workflow we have developed for building interviews with students. It includes some brief onboarding exercises that will help you if this is your first time building a Docassemble interview.

:::tip
If you are new to building Docassemble interviews and you have not gone through the [orientation steps](interview_builder_orientation), it's a good idea to take an hour or so to do them before you continue with this page.

### 2. Prepare the Court Form for the Weaver

Before you can use the Weaver you must prepare each PDF or DOCX document with fields and labels for the Weaver to recognize. These pages will help:

* ["Weaving" your form into a draft interview](../generating_code)
* [Working with PDF Files](../pdfs)
* [Working with DOCX Files](../docx)
* [Field labels to use in template files](../label_variables)

If you don't have much experience with the Weaver, ask someone with more experience to review your prepared documents before you run them through.

While you prepare your document(s) for the Weaver, get set up in GitHub and start using our project template.
