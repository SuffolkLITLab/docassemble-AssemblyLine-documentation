[RateMyPDF](https://ratemypdf.com) is a tool built by Suffolk LIT Lab to help you
measure and improve the usability of court forms.

RateMyPDF assigns your PDF a score that reflects 14 different dimensions, including:

*	Reading grade level (a consensus score)
*	Percent of difficult words (currently drawn from the Dale-Chall word list)
*	Use of calculations
*	Number of pages
*	Number of legal citations per field
*	Average number of fields per page
*	Normalized answer length per field
*	Sentences per page
*	Percent of passive voice sentences
*	Percent of words written in all capital letters
*	Percent of "slot-in" fields
*	Percent of "gathered" fields
*	Percent of "third-party" fields
*	Percent of "created" fields


RateMyPDF compares your score to a benchmark that was created by gathering
24,000 forms from 46 States and the District of Columbia in the USA. It also includes specific
recommendations to improve several of the measurements.

## Why readability scores aren't good enough

[Readability](style_guide_readability.md) has been one of the only available
tools to measure the ease of use of court forms. Forward thinking courts have
readability targets of 6th grade. But because people don't just read forms--they
answer questions and follow instructions--readability isn't a very good measure
of form complexity, at least not on its own:

1. Forms use lots of short text (like: Address, Name, and so on), while
   readability scores are designed to evaluate long narratives.
1. Litigants **answer questions** and **follow instructions** on forms as well
   as reading words.
1. Answers can require getting information from a third party, finding a
   specific piece of paper (like an ID card), doing math, or making a decision.
1. Answers can be very sensitive, either because they are about private
   information, like a Social Security Number, or because they evoke a traumatic
   response, like details of an assault.   
1. Answers come in different formats, too. The difference between checking a box
   and writing out a long answer is significant.

Complexity and sensitivity can't always be avoided. For example: a complaint
asking for protection from abuse needs to disclose some information about the
abuse. But forms should never impose a burden on the litigant that doesn't have
a matching benefit.

## How we created our score

We built the RateMyPDF score by combining feedback from:

* Form automators
* Form authors
* Legal aid experts
* Court staff
* And our own in-house experience from building the Document Assembly Line.

The tool leverages a custom ML model, GPT-3, and heuristics to do the hard work.

A key feature of our score is that it leverages Caroline Jarrett and Gerry
Gaffney's
[framework](https://www.amazon.com/Forms-that-Work-Interactive-Technologies/dp/1558607102)
that classifies form responses as either:

* Slot-in
* Gathered
* Third-party, or
* Created

## Use and limitations

### The measurement effect

As soon as form authors are aware of the concrete score that our tool provides,
we recognize that its value will decrease. A form specially tuned to score well
on an automated assessment may do so by manipulating features of the form that
were only proxies for the usability of the form itself.

We think our measure will be helpful to provide an initial score for a form. But
use the general principles contained on this website to improve your form
thereafter, and don't focus too much on the specifics of your score after revision.

### Inherent limitations in mechanical scores

Automated scores like the RateMyPDF score have limitations in accuracy. Our score
takes only attributes that are easily measurable and combines them into an overall
score, but it misses nuance and specifics to the form and its context.

The gold standard for improving forms is an individual usability test. You can run
a usability test for as little as a few hundred dollars and half a dozen hours of
time, and we think you should! We have written up a [short guide to usability testing here](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/testing/testing/#usability-tests).

But usability testing:

* Can still be expensive or difficult to do at scale
* Requires applying judgment to disaggregate the causes of poorly performing forms.

We think mechanical scores can be very helpful to sort and classify large numbers of
forms at once and to provide a basic direction for improving even individual forms
when not applied dogmatically.

## Who built this

* Bryce Willey
* Quinten Steenhuis
* David Colarusso

And we worked closely with:

* Caroline Robinson
* Lily Yang
* Michelle B.

to identify and validate the features the RateMyPDF score measures.
