We strongly recommend using [GitHub](https://github.com/) with Docassemble. GitHub is a version control system. It lets you save a snapshot of your interview that you can revert to an earlier version if you need to and see changes over time. GitHub also makes it easier to build interviews as a team, get help, and hand off your code to future interview builders and maintainers.

Here are some more reasons to use GitHub with Docassemble:

* Save versions of the interview code you are working on so you can back up to an earlier version/save point if new edits break something.
* Collaborate with others to build Docassemble interviews, get help, and hand off your code to future interview builders and maintainers.
* Share your code with others who might want to build similar interviews.
* Create branches to work on specific issues, or create multiple branches to keep different issues isolated from each other while you work on them.
* Track and discuss issues with your code, like tasks, bugs, feature requests, etc. Issues can be assigned, tagged, and attached to commits and pull requests that complete or fix them.
* Use projects to gather issues from multiple repositories and organize them on a Kanban-style project board.

:::info
This page covers how to use GitHub with Docassemble. Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en) if you have questions about its features. The [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) may also be helpful if you want to understand GitHub's underlying version control software.
:::

## Workflow

Here is what we recommend for a workflow for using GitHub with the Docassemble playground. Repeat these steps each time you start working on a new task or issue:

1. Create a new project in your Docassemble playground. Give it a name that describes the work to be done, then pull the `main` branch of your interview from GitHub into the project.
2. When you make your first commit from the new project, [commit to a new branch](#commit-your-code).
3. When you finish working on the branch, commit it one last time, then go to the repository in GitHub and [create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request). If you are working with someone on the interview, request a review from them.
4. Once you have resolved any conflicts and any reviewers have signed off, merge the pull request.
5. Decide on the next task or issue you want to work on and start over at #1.

For more detail on these steps, see below.

## How To

### Set Up the GitHub Integration

In order to use GitHub with Docassemble you will need two things:

1. Developer privileges on a Docassemble development server with the [GitHub integration configured](https://docassemble.org/docs/installation.html#github). (If you don't have access to a Docassemble development server, [contact us](mailto:litlab@suffolk.edu).)
2. A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. If this is a new account, you may want to [keep your email address private](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-on-github) and [avoid sharing your email address on commits](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/blocking-command-line-pushes-that-expose-your-personal-email-address).

Then, follow the [Docassemble instructions for publishing an interview package to GitHub](https://docassemble.org/docs/packages.html#github). This will create a repository in your personal GitHub account. After you have created the repository, follow [these GitHub instructions to transfer it to your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository).

:::tip
In order to transfer a repository to an organization you must be a member of the organization and have permission to create a repository in the organization.
:::

### Create and Manage Playground Projects

To create and manage projects, in the Docassemble playground click **Playground** in the nav menu and select **Manage Projects**.

:::tip
You must use [PascalCase](naming#pascalcase) when naming projects.
:::

### Commit Your Code

1. In the Docassemble playground, click on the **Folders** menu and select **Packages**.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the **GitHub** button.
3. Select the branch you want to commit to, enter a [commit message](#commit-messages), and click the **Commit** button. 

That's it! Your commit should show up on GitHub!

### Create a Pull Request

Refer to the [GitHub documentation for how to create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

### Resolve Conflicts

Refer to the [GitHub documentation on resolving merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github).

:::tip
To reduce merge conflicts:

1. Keep the goals of your branches "small" so there are fewer changes to merge.
2. Merge pull requests in the order they were made.
3. Communicate with your team in order to avoid working on the same sections of code at the same time.
:::

### Review Pull Requests

When someone assigns you to review a pull request (PR), you will be able to see it in [your GitHub notifications](https://github.com/notifications). Don't let these requests sit around too long, or you increase the likelihood of [merge conflicts](#resolve-conflicts).

The requester should have left notes on what needs to be tested in the description of the pull request.

1. Pull the code into the a new playground project.
2. Test the change(s) made in the pull request.
3. If it does not do what it is supposed to do, leave a comment requesting changes.
4. If it does what it is supposed to do, approve the changes and then you or the PR submitter can merge the PR and delete the branch.

:::tip
You can [make comments connected to specific lines of code](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-comments-to-a-pull-request). This is often helpful when reviewing PRs.
:::

Afterward you can delete the playground project you created for the review.

## Best Practices

### Commit Early & Often

A commit is a save point. It saves your progress and creates a snapshot of the current state of your interview code. It also helps you find old, working code when something breaks or you need to track down a bug.

GitHub can't help you if you don't use it, so **commit early and often**!

:::tip
When you first start working with Docassemble it can be hard to remember to stop and commit. Try creating a daily reminder on your phone.
:::

You can commit to a branch as often as you want. Developers often wait to commit code until they have it working, but they also might commit broken code so other people can help them troubleshoot, or to save their progress. If you are concerned about ruining working code, [make a new branch](#making-a-new-branch-for-a-new-goal-or-bug-fix) for the broken code and commit it to that branch.

### Use Issues

In GitHub, **[issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)** are flexible items for planning, discussing, and tracking your work when building interviews. Issues are one of our primary tools for building and maintaining interviews. Discussions on issues can be especially useful for anyone who may work on the interview in the futureâ€”including you.

[Create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) for:

* Tasks
* Bugs
* Questions
* Features
* Ideas
* Documentation
* Etc.

You can also [close issues in commit messages and pull request descriptions](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).

### Branches, Pull Requests, and Commits

While you are building an interview, use branches to isolate the feature, bug, or other issue you are working on. Commit to the branch, and then when you are finished with the branch, [create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request) to merge your changes with `main`.

As a general rule the `main` branch should only be updated with pull requests from branches.

When naming branches or writing commit messages or pull request titles, it is helpful to describe the change(s) they relate to.

* Since branches usually precede pull requests in the [workflow](#workflow), branch names should anticipate the future pull request title.
* While you are working on a branch, [commit early and often](#commit-early--often), and use the commit message to describe the change you just made to the interview code. Examples of good commit messages:
* Pull request titles should describe the bigger change, and pull request descriptions should provide context, mention related issues, and generally explain the reason for the change.

Examples of a good branch name, commit messages, and pull request title:

* Branch name: **2024_court_form_updates**
* Commit messages:
    * **Update cash income question**
    * **Fix broken address field**
    * **Update e-filing codes**
    * **Update interview version**
* Pull request title: **Updates the interview for the new 2024 court form**

That way, when you look at the list of commits, pull requests, or branches you can more easily reconstruct the work you did (or in the case or branches, intended to do). This is especially helpful when you need to find working code from a previous save point.

## Troubleshooting Errors when Committing from Docassemble

When you get an error committing from Docassemble, it means Docassemble did not change anything on GitHub. One of three things is probably going on.

1. You have technically not made any changes to the code that is actually being pushed to GitHub.
2. You lack [permissions for the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github) you are trying to commit to.
3. There is a [merge conflict to resolve](#resolve-conflicts).

Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the details of the error. These are a step-by-step log of what is happening in git, the version-control system GitHub uses. The most recent message is at the bottom. (Ignore the line talking about a `Detached head`. That is actually a natural intermediate part of the process, not a problem.)

#### If You See `nothing to commit, working tree clean`

This means git cannot detect any changes in your code. You cannot commit anything from docassemble if you have not made changesâ€”not even to a new branch. These are some possibilities:

* If you created a new file you may have not added it to your playground package. Select **Folder** / **Packages** and scroll down to the **Interview files** and **Template files** sections. Use Command (âŒ˜)+click on a Mac and Ctrl+click on Windows to select the files you want to commit to the repository.
* You may not have saved changes to a file. If the file is still open you can click the **Save** button. If the file is closed you will have to open it and make the changes again.
* You may not actually have made any changes to the files even though you thought you did.

#### If You See `403`

A [**403** error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#403) means you do not have **write** permission for the repository. Ask the person or organization that owns it to give you permission or add you to a team that has permission.

If you are trying to make a new repository on your GitHub account, you may belong to an organization that already has a  repository with the same name. You will either have to change the name, have the organization delete its repository, or get permission to write to the existing repository.

If you think your GitHub account does have permission, try [redoing the GitHub integration](https://docassemble.org/docs/installation.html#github).

#### If You See `CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict`

The text `CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict` means the branch you are trying to push to changed while you were making your changes. It is what a [merge conflict](#merge-conflicts) looks like in docassemble in git. Simply [make a new branch](#making-a-new-branch-for-a-new-goal-or-bug-fix) and commit the changes there. Work out the merge conflicts afterwards.

### Get GitHub code into your Playground

aka. Uploading your code to the Playground, uploading someone else's code to the Playground, reviewing, pulling, getting your old code back, seeing someone else's code, working on someone else's code

:::warning
**WARNING:** All the files in the repository will replace files of the same name in this Project. Imagine being on your computer, copying a bunch of files to a folder, and getting the message "This file already exists in this folder. Do you want to replace it?". It's the same thing, but docassemble doesn't give you that warning.

If you want to save your changes, [create a new branch](#making-a-new-branch-for-a-new-goal-or-bug-fix) for it before pulling the new code in.
:::

**Summary**

1. [Make a new Project in docassemble](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#projects) and [go to "Packages"](#go-to-the-package).
1. In the menu of blue text at the top, tap 'Pull'.
1. Go to GitHub and get the url (web address) of the repository that has the code.
1. From the dropdown, pick the branch you want to pull from and tap 'Pull'.
1. Go back to your Playground and play!

**Details**

[Make a new Project in docassemble](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#projects) then [go to your Packages folder](#go-to-the-package). In the menu at the top, tap "Pull".

![Navigate to the Package Pull page](./assets/da_package_navigate_to_pull.png)

Copy the GitHub url of the repository you are pulling from.

![Get the repository url](./assets/github_repo_url.png)

Make sure there is no trailing slash.<br/>
**Yes:** https://github.com/some_user/docassemble-SomeRepository <br/>
**No:** https://github.com/some_user/docassemble-SomeRepository<strong>/</strong>


Back in docassemble, paste the url in the text field.

![Paste the repository url](./assets/da_package_pull_repo_url.png)

Tap the dropdown menu and select the branch you want to bring in.

![Choose the right branch](./assets/da_package_pull_repo_branch.png)

Tap "Pull".

![Tap the Pull button](./assets/da_package_pull_branch_button.png)

When you return to the Playground, you should see a file from the code you have pulled in.

<!-- 
### Combining code - accepting changes

aka. Merging/merge, pulling/pull, adding someone else's changes to your code

1. That person should have made a pull request with their branch.
1. Test their code.
1. Optional, but decent practice: In GitHub, leave a review message and approval, or ask for changes (in the 'files changed' tab). (bandwidth: add 1. comments on lines)
1. If you approve of it, hit 'Merge pull request' at the bottom of the 'conversations' tab.
1. Hit 'Confirm merge' finish.
1. You or they should delete their branch.
1. You and they should delete the Playground Project you created for the branch.

In your GitHub repository, tap "Pull request"

You will see a list of pull request for the repository, tap on the one you've finished testing.

Here the pull request is "Add examples in questions"

A screen similar to this will appear, you can tap "Files changed" to do a review of what in the code was changed.

This is a side by side comparison of the code.  

Tap "Review changes"

Provide information in the review.

If you are not ready to merge the code because you have a question or hesitation, select "Comment".

If the code is working and looks good, it is ready to merge and select "Approve".

If you found an error or think something needs to change before merging, select "Request changes" 

Tap "Submit review"

If you've approved the code, move forward in the steps.

Finishing your review will automatically move you back to the Conversation tab seen here.

If you are ready to merge: 

Mid way on the screen is the "Merge pull request" option 

Tap it.

To make sure, it asks again.

Tap "Confirm merge" 

The box, once a green icon is now purple, and you've successfully merged the pull request.

You will end up with tons of branches and forget what is what. Once its merged tap "Delete branch."

You will see a message similar to this once complete.

The final step is to delete the Project in the Dev App.

<!-- 
### The original branch changed while I was working on a different branch
aka. I want to see how my changes will work in the interview, merge conflicts, updating to master, updating to the base branch, catching up to the base branch, combining two branches, branches have diverged

Your **base branch** is the branch that you want to add this new code to. It is often your repository's 'master' or 'main', but not always. There are different reasons you might want to combine changes that have diverged.
1. If your base branch got changed and you either need or want to be able to work with those changes too, you can make a branch that combines both branches and use that to move forward.
1. If you base branch got changed and you want to now merge your own changes into the base branch.

1. Make a new branch from the base branch.
1. Make a pull request from the base branch into your branch.
1. Fix merge conflicts.
1. Review.
1. Merge it when ready.

If you want to continue making changes independently, this will be the branch you will now pull into your Playground.

If you want to bring your changes into the base branch, you are now ready to [make a pull request](#request-others-merge-your-code) on the base branch.
 -->
<!-- 
1. Make another branch off of the master branch.
1. Merge the new code into that branch.
1. Do the usual tests with that code.
1. When it's ready, merge that newest branch into master (by making a pull request into master).
1. If your team has agreed on this convention, delete the branch.
1. Delete the Project on your Playground.
1. Close the issues associated with the changes (if they haven't been closed automatically through magical means you can read about in another, more bandwidth, section)

We're still thinking about what to do If they update their code in the meantime and you need to see the combination/merged version.
 -->


## Navigating

Find docassemble pages like the Playground and the Packages pages.

### Go to the Playground
![Go to the Playground through the dropdown](./assets/da_dropdown_to_playground.png)

## Advanced/Needs bandwidth

### Close an issue with a PR

See the GitHub docs on [closing an issue with a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue). The issue will only be closed when the PR is merged into your [default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch) (usually the one called 'main'). Example: `Add all financial questions, fix #15`

You can also just create a link to an issue with a PR or commit by omitting the closing keywords shown in the GitHub documentation. Just use the pound sign (`#`) and the number of the issue. Example: `Add question about assets, #15`
<!-- 
**Adding a link to an issue in your commit or PR**

Do not use a closing keyword. Just use the issue number alone in your PR description. Ex: #22. GitHub should note the connection in the relevant issue.
-->
<!-- 
### Branches

**Making a new branch without any new content** (TODO)

This has to be done on GitHub. GitHub documentation might help.

You can make branches off of

TODO: Link to definition of 'base branch'

You can also make a branch off of *that* new branch if you want. There's nothing special about the main branch. They're all just branches. You pull from `some_branch`, edit code, then 'commit' to a 'New branch' we'll call `yet_another_branch` and you've done it. `some_branch` is now the **base** branch of `yet_another_branch`.

TODO: Add link to making branches off of branches from within docassemble? (add section)

TODO: Add more about what's important to look at for a pull request?

TODO: Add section on getting rid of zombie files.

TODO: Add HTTP status error codes to a 'further reading'/'other resources' section?

TODO: Add updating a branch to the changes in its base branch. Include warning about merge conflict that will make changes in both branches.

TODO: Why to keep default branch clean. e.g. if a hot fix is needed, it can be implemented without concern for other stuff that's broken.
-->

<!-- 
What was this about?
### Extra information GitHub can show you

**Comparing code**

**Am I in the right branch?**

1. Look at the last commit and its date (pic needed). Does that match up with what you remember?
1. Compare the file you have in the playground with the file in that branch of the repository.
1. If not, try a different branch
-->

### Which branch am I editing?

In docassemble it can be hard to tell if you are in the correct Project or which branch's files you are editing.

1. [Go to Playground > Folders > Packages](#go-to-the-package).
1. Scroll down to the GitHub section.
1. You will see the name of this package's branch in the links above the GitHub button and can follow a link to go to the repository.

![Links to GitHub repository](./assets/da_package_links_to_github.png)

### Make a new package with selected files

aka. Make a new package, cherry pick some files to make a package, select individual files.

1. If you have not done so yet, pull in the repository branch with the files you want.
1. Stay in the Packages page.
1. At the top of the page, tap "Add".
1. Give the new package [a name using the appropriate rules](name_formats.md#docassemble-projects-and-packages-pascalcase).
1. Select the file you want in this package. They can be the same files as before.
1. [Commit](#commit---early-and-often)
