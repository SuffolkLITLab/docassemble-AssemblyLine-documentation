#### standard\_holidays(year, country="US", subdiv="MA", add\_holidays: Optional[Mapping] = None, remove\_holidays: Optional[Iterable[str]] = None)

```python
def standard_holidays(
        year,
        country="US",
        subdiv="MA",
        add_holidays: Optional[Mapping] = None,
        remove_holidays: Optional[Iterable[str]] = None
) -> holidays.HolidayBase
```

Get all holidays in the specified year, country, and state (or other subdivision).
Note that this draws on the &quot;holidays&quot; package which may deviate slightly from
holidays observed by a local court, but should be very close to accurate.

**Arguments**:

- `year` - the year to get holidays for
- `country` - the country to use holidays from (default: &quot;US&quot;)
- `subdiv` - the subdivision (e.g. state or province) to use holidays from (default: &quot;MA&quot;)
- `add_holidays` - a dictionary from date strings (&quot;12-25&quot;) to the name of the holiday, to add custom holidays
- `remove_holidays` - a list of holiday name strings to remove from the standard holidays
  

**Returns**:

  A dictionary like-object that you can treat like:
    ```
    \{
        "2021-01-01": "New Year's Day",
        ...
        "2021-12-25": "Christmas Day",
    \}
    ```
  In place of a string, the object that is returned can also be treated as though
  the keys are datetime.date objects.
  

**Examples**:

    ```python
    # Get standard holidays for Massachusetts in 2023
    ma_holidays = standard_holidays(2023)
    print(ma_holidays["2023-07-04"])  # Independence Day

    # Get holidays for a different state
    ca_holidays = standard_holidays(2023, country="US", subdiv="CA")

    # Add custom holidays
    custom_holidays = standard_holidays(
        2023,
        add_holidays=\{"03-17": "Company Founding Day"\}
    )
    print(custom_holidays["2023-03-17"])  # Company Founding Day

    # Remove holidays that your court doesn't observe
    court_holidays = standard_holidays(
        2023,
        remove_holidays=["Columbus Day", "Veterans Day"]
    )
    ```

<a id="ALToolbox.business_days.non_business_days"></a>

```python
def non_business_days(year,
                      country="US",

                      last_n_dates=0) -> dict
```

Get all non-business days (weekends and holidays) in the specified year, country, and state.
This function returns a dictionary of all dates that are not business days, including
both weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and official holidays.

- `country` - the country to use holidays from (default: &quot;US&quot;)

- `add_holidays` - a dictionary from date strings (&quot;12-25&quot;) to the name of the holiday, to add custom holidays
- `remove_holidays` - a list of holiday name strings to remove from the standard holidays
- `first_n_dates` - if specified, only return the first N non-business days of the year
- `last_n_dates` - if specified, only return the last N non-business days of the year
  

**Returns**:

  A dictionary where keys are date strings (&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) and values are the name of the non-business day
  (e.g., &quot;Saturday&quot;, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;).
  

**Examples**:

    ```python
    # Get all non-business days for 2023
    all_non_business = non_business_days(2023)
    print(len(all_non_business))  # Shows total count of non-business days

    # Get just the first 10 non-business days of the year
    first_ten = non_business_days(2023, first_n_dates=10)

    # Get the last 5 non-business days of the year
    last_five = non_business_days(2023, last_n_dates=5)

    # Get non-business days with custom holidays
    custom_non_business = non_business_days(
        2023,
        add_holidays=\{"03-17": "Company Founding Day"\}
    )
    ```
