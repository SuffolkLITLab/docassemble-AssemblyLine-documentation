#### create\_package\_zip(pkgname: str, info: dict, author\_info: dict, folders\_and\_files: dict, fileobj: Optional[DAFile] = None)

```python
def create_package_zip(pkgname: str,
                       info: dict,
                       author_info: dict,
                       folders_and_files: dict,
                       fileobj: Optional[DAFile] = None) -> DAFile
