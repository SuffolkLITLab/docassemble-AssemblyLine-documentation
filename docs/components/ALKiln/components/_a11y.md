If there are problems with the accessibility of the page, ALKiln will continue to the end of the test, but it will save a separate JSON accessibility report file for a page that fails this check. For example, if text is too small or if contrast between the text and its background is too low. If ALKiln found problems, the test will fail at the end.

ALKiln uses [aXe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) to check for problems. You can check the documentation there to understand the failure data better. A human can do a much more thorough job of improving accessibility, but this can be a start.
