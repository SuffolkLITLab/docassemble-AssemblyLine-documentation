## Multiple ways to run ALKiln

([Moving](setup.mdx))

You don't have to choose just one way to run ALKiln, you can use all of them. Here are some differences to help you use each more effectively.

### Testing your Playground Projects

([Moving](alkiln_setup#diy-details))

[ALKilnInThePlayground](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-ALKilnInThePlayground) is a package you can install on your server. When you run its interview, you will be able to pick a Project from your Playground and run the tests in that Project.

**Pros**

([Moving](setup.mdx#diy-pros))

- You don't need to put your package on GitHub to run the tests.
- Running ALKiln on your server lets you loop through your development cycle faster - edit, test, edit, test. You don't have to go through committing your code to GitHub every time.
- You can see the output online right away, including images and documents. In GitHub, to see _all_ of the output files, you have to download a zip file. The only thing you can see online in GitHub is the summary report.
- You can more easily limit your tests to a specific set of tests using [tag expressions](https://www.cuketest.com/en/cucumber/tag-expressions). You can use tags on GitHub too, it just takes more steps.
- You can more often avoid the red "x" that appears next to failing tests on GitHub. The red "x" is a useful piece of information, but it can be uncomfortable.

**Cons**

([Moving](setup.mdx#diy-cons))

- You'll miss catching some kinds of mistakes. Specifically, you may add a file to your Playground and forget to commit it to GitHub. Your tests will pass in your Playground, but your interview will break when you or others install it from GitHub.
- If your server reloads while the tests are running, ALKiln may come to a complete stop and you'll have to start the tests all over again.

**What ALKiln is doing**

([Moving](setup.mdx#diy-stages))

When you run Playground tests, they do the following:

1. ALKiln navigates to the file your tests specifies in the Project you picked.
1. For each test (or Scenario), ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to whatever interview you named in the test in the Project you chose.
1. It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test.
1. If one of the Steps fails, ALKiln adds that to the test report and tries to take a picture of the page with the problem. It tries to avoid taking pictures of sensitive information.

When the tests are done, the output page will show you all the generated reports, images, and files if it can. It will also give you a link to download some of that in a `.zip` file.


### Triggering tests on your server from GitHub

([Moving](alkiln_setup#githubNyou-details))

These tests run on GitHub, but they still interact with your server and basically do the same things the Playground tests do, you're just not there to see.

**Pros**

([Moving](setup.mdx#githubNyou-pros))

- ALKiln on GitHub will test any changes any team member commits. On your server, you only tests your changes.
- On GitHub, there are ways to schedule tests to run regularly - every week, every day, or whatever schedule you prefer. If packages you depend on change and break your code, those tests will let you know.
- If you've forgotten to add a file to the package that an interview depends on (like a missing template file), GitHub will catch that. It installs the file fresh in a new Project, so it only has the files that have been committed properly.
- You can continue editing any files in your Playground while the GitHub tests run because GitHub creates a whole new Project of its own. When running tests on your server, you must avoid editing the Project that ALKiln is testing.
- You can configure your GitHub "action" to do other things, like create GitHub issues whenever tests fail.
- If your server reloads during the test run, a few individual tests may fail, but ALKiln will still be able to continue and keep trying to run the rest of the tests. That is because the test code is in running from GitHub, so your reload doesn't stop that process.

**Cons**

([Moving](setup.mdx#githubNyou-cons))

- To get these set up, you need to create a docassemble API key, a GitHub token, and make GitHub secrets and you may have to update these in the future. [The ALKiln test setup interview](https://apps-dev.suffolklitlab.org/start/test-setup) helps you do these things, but they can still be confusing.
- Your tests might be more flaky. That means they may fail for reasons that don't have to do with the interviews. For example, if your tests are running while your server is reloading, ALKiln will keep running, so other tests will still have an opportunity to continue, but individual tests may fail even if your code is correct. Your server can reload for many reasons - updating your config, installing a new package, etc. When tests fail meaninglessly, it slows down your development cycle and sometimes people end up turning off the tests instead of dealing with the complexity.

**What ALKiln is doing**

([Moving](setup.mdx#gNy-stages))

Whenever you push (or commit) to GitHub, GitHub will run the tests automatically. You can also [trigger them manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow).

- ALKiln goes to the testing account you set up on your server and creates a new Project. If you log into that account, you'll be able to see the new Project in the list of projects.
- It pulls the relevant branch of your package into the Project.
- For each test (or Scenario), ALKiln pretends to be a human and goes to whatever interview you named in the test.
- It tries to fill out the fields as the test has instructed, and to take the actions described in the test.
- If one of the Steps fails, ALKiln adds that to the test report and tries to take a picture of the page with the problem. It tries to avoid taking pictures of sensitive information.
- When all the tests are done, ALKiln deletes the Project it created.

([Moving](writing_tests.mdx#running-data))

You can see the tests running on your repository's [GitHub Actions page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#viewing-the-workflows-activity).

([Moving](writing_tests.mdx#results))

At the end, you can see a report and logs right in the [workflow's "job" page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs) or [download a `.zip` file containing the results of the tests to your computer](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts). That `.zip` file is what GitHub calls an "artifact".


### Testing on a temporary isolated GitHub server

([Moving](alkiln_setup#sandbox-details))

These tests also run on GitHub, but they create a new docassemble server on GitHub itself and interact with that. They never touch your server.

**Pros**

([Moving](setup.mdx#sandbox-pros))

- This is the most secure of all the methods. The tests don't interact with your server at all.
- Since the other tests should be running on a test server, not a production server, this shouldn't be a big advantage, but still - the tests have less chance of accidentally exposing the information of other users on that server.
- All
- the
- advantages
- listed
- above
- for the other type of GitHub tests except this improvement: Your tests will generally be less flaky. When a test fails it's more likely to be a problem with your code instead of a problem with the server. That's because the server is isolated on GitHub and no one is going to make that isolated server reload in the middle of the tests.
- You don't have to set up or update any docassemble API keys or GitHub tokens.

**Cons**

([Moving](setup.mdx#sandbox-cons))

- Tests take about 5 minutes longer since they have to do things like create a docker container and start a server.
- The GitHub server installs the latest version of docassemble, which might be a different version than the one you use on your server. Allowing authors to install specific versions would take longer to run. We're still considering if this is a feature we should create. We would appreciate feedback.
- Regardless of that, whatever server GitHub generates probably won't have the exact same setup as your server, so some interviews may not have the same behavior.
- You have to be more diligent about including all the "Dependencies" that your package needs on your interview's "Packages" page. If you don't, they won't be installed with your package on this fresh server.

**What ALKiln is doing**

([Moving](setup.mdx#sandbox-stages))

Like the other GitHub test method, whenever you push (or commit) to GitHub, GitHub will run the tests automatically. You can [run these manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow) as well.

- ALKiln creates a fresh docker container and docassemble server in GitHub itself. If you have given ALKiln a docassemble config, it uses that config.
- It tries to get the log for that process and saves it as an artifact on your GitHub action's summary page.
- It installs the interview as a package directly on the server.
- ALKiln does the same things we described above, creating the same GitHub artifacts.
- When all the tests are done, GitHub destroys the server that ALKiln created.

:::tip

(Deleted because users never get to it)

If you do run both the GitHub-triggered tests and the GitHub isolated server tests, you'll get the fastest results possible. That is, if all goes well, the GitHub-triggered tests might end first and pass. If they don't and the problem is just with your server, the GitHub isolated server tests might complete sooner. If your server is fine, the GitHub-triggered tests will again finish faster. You'll get the fastest results possible.

([Moving](writing_tests.mdx#quota))

[GitHub quota limits](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration) probably won't be a problem, especially not for public repos.
