## Goals

This bootcamp aims to bring you up to speed on the Document Assembly Line project. It will do this by helping you start to automate a form of your choosing and introducing you to a number of Assembly Line tools and practices. By the end of the bootcamp, you should feel comfortable participating in discussions with other members of the team about your work and how to troubleshoot issues you are facing.

## Meeting times

Thursdays @ 11am-1pm Eastern: February 18th, February 25th, March 4th, and March 11th, 2021.

Each bootcamp meeting will be at [this Zoom link](https://suffolk.zoom.us/j/96015143827). If you signed up at the link above, you should have received the Zoom link and the password in a calendar invite. If you haven't received an invite or you haven't signed up, email "mass access at suffolk dot edu."
