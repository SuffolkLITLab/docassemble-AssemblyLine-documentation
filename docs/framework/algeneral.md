## Python classes for representing people and addresses

### ALAddress and ALAddressList classes {#ALAddress}

The `ALAddress` class is an extension of the built-in Docassemble
[`Address`](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html#Address) class.

If an address is an `ALAddress`, it has an `address_fields()` method that can be used
inside a `fields: code: |` statement to insert a consistently formatted series of
address fields. `address_fields()` will include an autocomplete method and is 
internationalized.

Assembly Line question library questions use `ALAddress` objects for both the
`address` and `mailing_address` attributes of people.

Example:

```yaml
---
objects:
  - the_address: ALAddress
---
id: address question
sets:
  - the_address.address
  - the_address.city
question: |
  What is the address?
fields:
  - code: |
      the_address.address_fields()
```

See [`Addresses`](question_library/addresses.md) for more information and
examples.

:::note 
You must use `sets` with the `address_fields()` method. Otherwise
Docassemble will not be able to find the block to provide a definition
of the address fields.
:::

The `address_fields()` method includes the following optional parameters:

* `country_code`: if provided, will be used to control the list of states that
  is displayed as well as the default country in the `country` drop down. In
  the Assembly Line question library, `country_code` typically defaults to the value of
  `AL_DEFAULT_COUNTRY`
* `default_state`: default state, province, or sub locality. In the Assembly Line
  question library, `default_state` typically defaults to the value of
  `AL_DEFAULT_STATE`
* `show_country`: defaults to `False`. If enabled, a country drop down menu will
  be displayed.

#### ALAddressList {#ALAddressList}

The `ALAddressList` class is a collection of `ALAddress`es. It is used to
allow you to collect multiple addresses in one go and otherwise works exactly
like the built-in Docassemble [`DAList`
object](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html#DAList).

The `__str__()` method of an `ALAddressList` has been modified so that using it
displays a series of addresses on one line, separated by `;`. This is used
any place that Docassemble treats the variable as text, such as in a
template, attachment block, or in a `question` or `subquestion` field.

Example:

`${ person.previous_addresses }` might display `123 Main St, Boston, MA; 456 Broadway, Cambridge, MA`.

The `previous_addresses` attribute of an `ALIndividual` is an `ALAddressList`.

### ALIndividual and ALPeopleList classes {#ALIndividual}

The `ALIndividual` is an extension of the Docassemble
[`Individual`](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html#Individual) class. It
should be used to represent both natural people and businesses or other
entities.

`ALIndividual` objects include the following methods that are not in the stock
`Individual` class:

* `signature_if_final(i)` is meant to be used inside a template or attachment
  block with the `ALDocument` class. It displays the signature if and only if
  `i` == 'final'.
* `phone_numbers()` displays either `mobile_number`, `phone_number`, or both if
  both are present for use in a PDF form with only one space to list phone
  numbers.
* `contact_methods()` displays a list of the contact methods the user provided
  in the default question library "contact information" screen as a formatted
  string. Specifically, it will display `mobile_number`, `phone_number`,
  `email`, and `other_contact_method`. This may be helpful in a formatted letter.
* `age_in_years()` returns the individual's age as an integer (whole number), calculated from the individual's `birthdate` attribute.
* `formatted_age()` is like `age_in_years()` but returns a formatted string with
  `years`, `months`, `weeks`, and `days` included when relevant. The cutoff is 2
  weeks to display days, 2 years to display months, and anything over 2 years
  displays only years.
* `name_fields(person_or_business:str = 'person', show_suffix=True)` is like
  `address_fields()` and is used to display a list of either 3 or 4 fields for a
  person's name. See [`Names`](question_library/names.md)
* `address_fields()` is a wrapper around the `address_fields()` method of an
  `ALAddress` with the same parameters.
* `gender_fields(show_help=False)` is like the `address_fields()` method but
  displays a list of vetted gender options. Read more about
  [`gender`](/question_library/gender.md) questions.
* `initials()` is used to return a string with the 1, 2, or 3 initial letters of
  a person's name. E.g., `QKS` for Quinten K Steenhuis.
* `language_fields(choices=List[Dict[str, str]])` provides a language selector that sets the `.language` attribute of the user, together with an `other` fill-in. This should be the two-letter ISO language code. We recommend defining and passing a dictionary named `al_language_user_choices` which will also be used by built-in questions triggered from `ql_baseline.yml`.
* `language_name()` will return the language name in English. If there is a system-wide translation `words.yml` translation file and the user's interface is in that language, the language name will be translated. If the user selected an `other` option, the `other` option will be returned.

Read-only attributes:

The following are all read-only attributes you can use with PDF checkbox fields.
They return `True` or `False` depending on the value of the `gender` attribute.

* `gender_male`
* `gender_female`
* `gender_nonbinary`
* `gender_other` (True if and only if the `gender` attribute is not "female" or "male")
* `gender_unknown`
* `gender_self_described`

##### Relation to the `Individual` class

The `ALIndividual` class inherits from Docassemble's [`Individual`](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html#Individual) class, and all other methods of `Individual` work
the same way as they do in the `Individual` class.

#### ALPeopleList {#ALPeopleList}

The `ALPeopleList` class is used to represent a group of people. Otherwise it
works exactly like the built-in Docassemble [`DAList`
object](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html#DAList).

It also has the following additional methods:

* `familiar()` returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each
  member of the list, with `and` joining the last two items 
* `familiar_or()` returns a comma-separated list of just the first name of each
  member of the list, with `or` joining the last two items
* `short_list(limit:int, truncate_string:str=', et. al.')` returns a list that
  will be cut off at the `limit` provided. By default, `, et. al.` is appended.
  The text can be customized.

:::note 
In the lists above, `and` and `or` can be translated using
[`words.yml`](https://docassemble.org/docs/config.html#words))
:::

Example:

`users.short_list(2)` will display `John Smith and Jane Smith, et. al.` if the
list contains John Smith, Jane Smith, and Jane Doe. `et al` is not used if the
list is at or below the limit provided.

##### Relation to the `DAList` class

`ALPeopleList` inherits from Docassemble's
[`DAList`](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html#DAList) class, and retains
all methods and attributes of a `DAList`.

Specifically, the language methods, including the `pronoun()` and related
methods, can be used to display the correct pronoun depending on the number and
gender of the members of an `ALPeopleList`. E.g., `users.pronoun_possessive()`
will return `her` if there is a single user with the `gender` attribute value
"female", and `their` if there are multiple members of the list.

These methods can be helpful inside single-language pleading templates but
usually should not be used inside the interview itself, as they can make
translation challenging. While there are language-specific versions of these
methods, they can lead to odd ungrammatical "fragments". As tedious as it may
be, the best practice for translation inside the interview is to use conditional
logic for full sentences matching each gender and number.

### Classes for specific kinds of people {#other-people}

Currently, the Assembly Line interviews provide these classes that you can use 
to target questions to a specific type of person:

* `Tenant`
* `HousingAuthority`
* `Applicant`
* `Abuser`
* `Survivor`

Each class subclasses `ALIndividual` and shares its methods and attributes.
There are no special attributes or methods of these classes. They are
provided for you to customize questions.
