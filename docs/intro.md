The Document Assembly Line project will help you produce **[beautiful web apps](https://courtformsonline.org)** 
that help users complete legal forms more quickly.

Go straight from a PDF or DOCX file to a runnable prototype in less than an hour. Build out from
there with expert-vetted questions and standardized components using our step-by-step process.

We used [open source tools](https://docassemble.org) and [modern project
management techniques](https://trello.com) to:

* gather more than 200 volunteers from around the world
* break the process of document automation into a series of small steps, so a
  volunteer with just a few hours can still make a difference
* build a [tool](weaver_overview.md) that takes specially prepared court forms and turns them directly
  into draft [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org) interviews, ready to get
  feedback and iterate on
* draft easy to read questions and [guidelines](question_style_overview.md) to promote access to justice
  for users of all abilities and languages

### How we can help you

Suffolk Law School is looking for grant partners with our funder, [Pew](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/civil-legal-system-modernization)! Our grant cycle runs from October 2021 through October 2023.

Partners can be:

* Courts
* Legal aids and other nonprofits
* Law schools

We are in the early stage of building tools that help someone through the
lifecycle of a court form. We want early users to help us build the right tools
with the right features. We can help partners:

* [Visualize existing PDF forms](https://suffolklitlab.org/form-explorer/)
  across an entire jurisdiction
  * Gain machine learning-driven insights into:
  * Readability
  * Ease of completion
  * Shared fields and redundancies in your existing forms
* [Automate existing forms with Docassemble](plan_interview.md)
  * Eliminate repetitive work with integrated interview templates
  * Use standardized guided interview structure, questions and components
  * Translate into multiple languages
  * Get to a rough prototype with one click
* [Electronically file](efiling/overview.md) forms straight to a case
  management system
* [Get advice](question_style_overview.md) and guidance on drafting questions
* Get automated insights to improve your guided interview
  * Get instant feedback from our ongoing [style guide](question_style_overview.md)

Our tools are free and open source. Use them on your own or with our help.

### How you can help us

We are looking for experienced court administrators, legal experts, and document
automators to help us:

* Share existing, completed paper PDF forms from court dockets so we can
  understand the lifecycle of existing forms and identify intances where
  litigants are spending the most time
* Focus our insights on existing PDF forms to deliver the most value to courts
* Help us create a more useful model of what makes forms easy or hard for
  litigants to understand and use (we think readability is not enough)
* Improve and extend our [library of questions](question_library/names.md)
* Use and give us feedback on our [Assembly Line Weaver](plan_interview.md) tool
* Expand our [e-filing](efiling/overview.md) capabilities

## Our work

The video below provides an overview of the project (0-10 min) and a detailed
look at one of the forms (12-30 min). _Note: This video is a lecture from the
course [Coding the
Law](https://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2020/level/3/#intro_vid). So please
disregard comments about "prior classes" and pending homework assignments at the

## Our tools

We built the **[Weaver](weaver_overview.md)** to help turn a [labeled](doc_vars_reference.md)
PDF or Word document into a draft of a guided interview.

We built a **library of model questions** for common court form fields, like:

* names and addresses
* the user's role in a court case
* contact information
* selecting and identifying a court

These questions have been written to target a 6th grade reading level and to be
usable by people with different abilities.

We built an **[electronic-filing
integration](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/EfileProxyServer)** for Tyler
Technologies EFMs so your finished court form can be delivered straight to an
electronic docket. It works in Louisiana's home-grown e-filing system, too.

We are in the process of building an **automated style checker** and
**visualization tool** to help courts and legal aid providers understand how
their forms can be improved, both on an individual form level and in the
aggregate.

## Form features

All of the forms produced by our tools:

* have a common look and feel, with reusable components
* mobile friendly layout so users can do everything on a smartphone
* help in context to guide users to filling in the form correctly
* use a standardized structure and questions to build consistency and gain trust
* use address autocompletion, to improve accuracy and save user time
* allow users to text, email, or share a link to their work in progress with a
  friend or advocate helping them complete a form
* integrated feedback form to help users report bugs or send praise quickly
* gather anonymized statistics in aggregate for reporting on usage
* use our database of court locations and jurisdictions in Massachusetts to
  guide users to file in the right venue
* digital signatures

Some forms can also be directly filed with a court, using either email,
our integration with Tyler Technologies, or our integration with
Louisiana's Jefferson Parish.
