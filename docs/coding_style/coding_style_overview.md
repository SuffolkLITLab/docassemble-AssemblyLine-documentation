## Guiding principles

In creating this style guide, we relied on our own experience as both experienced and novice coders
to recommend simple interventions that will help all members of a coding team.

We tried to use the following principles to shape our recommendations:

1. Use existing style guides and best practices where they apply.
1. Where they don't exist yet, model new practices on existing ones so that
   developers need to remember fewer things.
