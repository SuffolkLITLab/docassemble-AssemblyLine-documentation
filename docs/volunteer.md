## Volunteer opportunities

There are several volunteer teams you can join:

* [Updates.](#interview-updates) Help us work through our backlog of interview improvements and updates.
* [Testing.](#user-testing) Test interviews and create issue reports to help us make improvements and updates.
* [Translation.](#translation) Review translations for accuracy.
* [Information gathering.](#information-gathering) Gather and update the information sources that power interview features, like courthouse addresses.

All volunteer work is done remotely, and all training, meetings, and communication happen online, via Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and GitHub.

### Interview updates

Update interviews from a backlog of tasks. This involves coding in Docassemble, but **no coding experience is necessary to join this team**. we will teach you everything you need to get started and support you with regular check-ins. You just need to be willing to learn!

Updating interviews is an ongoing project, and the updates team requires a long-term commitment. Volunteers should be able to commit at least 5–10 hours per month for at least 3 months.

### User testing

Test interviews independently or live over Zoom, depending on what we need to test. No experience or legal knowledge is necessary.

We organize an interview testing project about once a year, usually during the summer. Otherwise, we ask for testing volunteers as needed, by notifying the testing team via email and Teams. To get notified, complete the [signup form](#sign-up-to-volunteer) so we know you are interested.

### Translation

Review draft translations for accuracy to help make interviews more accessible. The translation team primarily needs native speakers to ensure clear translations.

We ask for translation volunteers as needed, by notifying the translation team via email and Teams. To get notified, complete the [signup form](#sign-up-to-volunteer) so we know you are interested.

### Information gathering

Gather and update information that powers guided interview features. For example, guided interviews may fill in courthouse addresses or suggest other resources, but that information is only useful if it is up-to-date.

We ask for information volunteers as needed, by notifying the information team via email and Teams. To get notified, complete the [signup form](#sign-up-to-volunteer) so we know you are interested.

## Expectations

We expect volunteers who are actively working on a project to check in regularly. In general, check-ins are brief. They are usually Zoom meetings, but in some cases we may use asynchronous updates in Teams.

The purpose of check-ins is to keep the project on track by sharing your progress, plan, and questions or blockers with your team:

1. **Progress.** What did you do last week?
2. **Plan.** What are you going to do this week?
3. **Questions/blockers.** Is anything preventing you from making progress?<br />Blockers can include questions, tech support issues, uncooperative third parties, etc. We often address questions and blockers live during meetings, or we can follow up later.

Also, let us know if you need something else to work on.
