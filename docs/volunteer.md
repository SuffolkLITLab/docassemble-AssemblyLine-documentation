We would love your help! building and maintaining the guided interviews on [Court Forms Online](https://courtformsonline.org/)!

## Volunteer opportunities

There are several ways you can volunteer with the Document Assembly Line:

* [Updates.](#interview-updates) Help us work through our backlog of update tasks.
* [Testing.](#user-testing) Test live interviews and report issues for the updates team.
* [Translation.](#translation) Review translations for accuracy.
* [Data validation.](#data-validation) Update data sources like courthouse addresses.

All volunteer work is done remotely, and all training, meetings, and communication happen online, via Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and GitHub.

### Interview updates

Update interviews from a backlog of tasks. This involves coding in Docassemble, but **no coding experience is necessary**. We will teach you everything you need to get started and support you with regular check-ins. You just need to be willing to learn!

The updates team requires a long-term commitment. Volunteers should be able to commit at least 5â€“10 hours per month for at least 3 months.

### User testing

Test interviews independently or live over Zoom, depending on what we need to test. No experience or legal knowledge is necessary.

We organize an interview testing project about once a year, usually during the summer, and we ask for live-testing volunteers as needed.

### Translation

Review draft translations for accuracy to help make interviews more accessible. The translation team primarily needs native speakers to ensure clear translations.

We ask for translation volunteers as needed.

### Data validation

Collect and update the information that powers guided interview features, such as courthouse addresses or resources.

We ask for data validation volunteers as needed.
