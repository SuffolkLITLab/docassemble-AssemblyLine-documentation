We welcome volunteers to help us build and maintain the online guided interviews on [Court Forms Online](https://courtformsonline.org/)!

## Volunteer opportunities

All training, meetings, and communication happen online, via Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and GitHub.

### Updating the interviews on Court Forms Online

This is our primary need, best suited to volunteers who can commit at least 5–10 hours per month for at least 3 months.

Volunteering involves working with Docassemble, but **no coding experience is necessary**. We can teach anyone who wants to learn.

You'll start by completing our interview builder training (currently three 90-minute live sessions, plus a final project). After your training, we'll assign your first task. (Visit our [Interview updates project board](https://github.com/orgs/SuffolkLITLab/projects/23/views/5) to see the kinds of tasks we have for volunteers.) You'll work independently, and attend our weekly community meetings or office hours (via Zoom) to keep us updated and get help when you need it.

Volunteers should be:

* Willing to learn to code in Docassemble
* Willing and able to commit 5–10 hours per month for at least 3 months
* Comfortable working independently and seeking help from the community when stuck
