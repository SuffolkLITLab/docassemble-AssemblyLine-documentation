This page provides a bird's-eye view of how various repositories of the **Document AssemblyLine Project** work together. This information is intended for those who want to take full advantage of the Project for their interviews, and for those who potentially want to adopt our Project for their own state or country.  

Below is a snapshot of the Project's overall architecture as of **October 2021**. We will periodically update this page, as the Project is still under active development to add new functionality and enhance the performance.
