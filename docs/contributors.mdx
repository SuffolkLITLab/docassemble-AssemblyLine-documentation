## Our Team

### People 

Not everyone on the team is on Twitter, but here's a [Twitter list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1246069325880012800?s=20) made up of team members. New folks are joining the team every day, and though we try to keep this list up-to-date, like this entire project, it is ever changing.
