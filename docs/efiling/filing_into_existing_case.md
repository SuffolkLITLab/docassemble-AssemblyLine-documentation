This document will show you a minimal way to file into an existing case with the e-filing system.

## Before starting

Before starting this guide, you should have:

* a working docassemble interview, preferable using the AssemblyLine.
  * If you don't have one yet, follow [these steps to author your interview](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/planning).
* contacted us for access to the EFSP server. We aren't yet making access publicly available, but will include an interest form here when we do.
* have completed the previous guide, ["E-filing through Docassemble"](efiling_through_docassemble.md), which covers the fundamentals of the e-filing system, including codes.

## Steps

If you're starting on a new server, remember to [re-setup the server to work with the efiling system](efiling_through_docassemble.md#server-setup).
