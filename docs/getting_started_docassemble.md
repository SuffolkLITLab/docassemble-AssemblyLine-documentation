## This documentation covers the custom stuff

While some of the documentation in this guide is general purpose,
we don't cover the basics of Docassemble development.

To learn about Docassemble syntax, such as:

- [The format of a Docassemble question file (YAML)](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/yaml)
- [Using Python in Docassemble](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/python)
- The syntax for inserting [Mako](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/mako) or [Jinja2](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/jinja2) variables
- Advanced logic, like [controlling question order](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/practical-guide-docassemble/controlling-interview-order)
- Working with Docassemble [objects](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/practical-guide-docassemble/object-oriented-programming) and object-oriented programming
- Using [repeated items](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/repeated-information) and lists in Docassemble

Please review:

* [Introduction to Docassemble](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/introduction-to-docassemble/) (and the pages that follow) for a readable, step-by-step guide to the core features and syntax of Docassemble
* [The official Docassemble documentation](https://docassemble.org/docs.html) for everything else. Be aware that the official documentation has a **lot** of content. Feel free to ask for help finding the right link!
